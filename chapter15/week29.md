## Notes

- The rate of a reaction is really important. How fast the reaction occurs tells us how much it will impact its surroundings.
- Kinetics - the study of chemical rates
- Simple rate formula - Rate = &#916;[C]/&#916;t where &#916;[C] is the change in concentration of the product C usually denoted in molarity (M) and &#916;t is the change in time usually denoted in seconds (s). If you measure the concentration of a reactant instead of a product you have to negate everything to keep the result positive.
- the reaction rate is usually proportional to the concentration of reactants. 
- the reaction rate is usually proportional to the surface area over which the reaction can occur.
- the reaction rate is usually proportional to the temperature.
- In general, the more contact the molecules/atoms of the reactants have, the faster they will react to form the products.
- Not all collisions between reactants are the same. In some cases the reactants have to collide in just the right way to react.
- Effective collisions are those collisions that lead to a reaction.
- rate equation - Rate = k[A]<sup>x</sup>[B]<sup>y</sup> where k is a rate constant that is particular to the reaction of A and B (so you need a table) and A and B are reactants and x and y are the "order" of the reaction. The word order here is similar to the word power or exponent, it refers to the fact that we are raising the concentration of A or B to a power. This may be 1 which doesn't change the number. (Remember that any number raised to the power of 1 is itself).
- The overall reaction order is given by adding x and y from the rate equation.
- So, what are the units for k? Well, it depends. We want the units in k to cancel out the other units leaving us with just M/s for rate. But [A] and [B] are both in M which will give us M<sup>2</sup>. And if the "order" of [A] or [B] is more than 1 then we have even more M's since [A]<sup>3</sup> => [A] * [A] * [A] => which makes the units M * M * M => M<sup>3</sup>. So, the units for k change depending on the overall order of the reaction.

## Examples

CC1. From 1.15 M at t = 0.0 s to 0.98 M at t = 15.0 s. Is it a product or reactant? What was the rate of change?
- The concetration went down, so this was a reactant.
- Rate = - &#916;[C]/&#916;t = - (0.98 M - 1.15 M)/(15.0 s - 0.0 s) = (0.17 M)/(15.0 s) = **0.011 M/s** 

CC2. Which has a lower reaction rate?
- large chunks or powdered - large chunks will have less surface area and reduce the number of collisions. So large chunks have a lower reaction rate.
- 15 degrees or 50 degrees - 15 degrees would slow down the molecules and reduce the number of collisions. So 15 degrees has a lower reaction rate.
- 5.0 M or 1.0 M - 1.0 M is less concentrated and therefore has less molecules per liter which will reduce the number of collisions. So, 1.0 M has a lower reaction rate.
