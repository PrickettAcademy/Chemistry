## Notes

- The rate constant (k) changes for every temperature. So the temperature of the reaction is built into the constant itself.
- the rate constant (k) increases with increasing temperature and decreases with increasing activation energy.
- Catalyst - a chemical that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being used up in the process.
- catalase - a chemical that decomposes oxidizing agents and is found in many living cells like yeast.
- catalysts lower the activation energy of the reaction which causes more collisions and speeds up the reaction.
- heterogeneous catalyst is one that is in a different phase from the reactants. These do not normally change the reaction mechanism.
- homogeneous catalyst is one that is in the same phase as the reactants. These usually change the reaction mechanism by actually reacting with one or more of the reactants, but then end up as products as well never being used up.

## Examples

CC6. which reaction has the higher rate constant?
- The reaction with the lowest activation energy will have the higher rate constant (that's b)

CC7. A chemist wants to compare reaction A (low activation energy) with reaction B (high activation energy) while they have the same reaction rate. Which one should he run at a higher temperature.
- A lower activation energy will have a higher rate constant, but you can increase the temperature to increase the rate constant
- He should run reaction B at a higher temperature to compensate for the high activation energy and increase the rate constant.

CC8. man pours hydrogen peroxide on a cut but it doesn't bubble up. Why?
- Most likely because the hydrogen peroxide is old and has already turned into water and oxygen.

CC9. Which reaction diagrammed is using a catalyst if both reactions are the same?
- The reaction with the lowest activation energy (b) is using a catalyst since the reactions are the same.

CC10. Which catalyst MnO<sub>2</sub> (s) or KI (aq) changes the reaction mechanism when decomposing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (aq)?
- Homogeneous catalysts change the reaction mechanism
- So, the catalyst in the same phase as the reactant is KI (aq)

CC11. identity the catalyst and the overall reaction: O<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2NO (g) --> 2NO<sub>2</sub> (g) and 2NO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g) --> 2SO<sub>3</sub> (g) + 2NO (g)
- We can combine the equations like this: O<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2NO (g) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g) --> 2SO<sub>3</sub> (g) + 2NO (g)
- From this we can see that **NO (g)** is both a reactant and a product which means it is our catalyst
- If we remove the catalyst from the equation, we get: **O<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g) --> 2SO<sub>3</sub> (g)**
