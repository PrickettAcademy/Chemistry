## Notes
- Atomic spectrum - the specific wavelengths of light emitted by an excited atom
- When elements are burned, they emit different colors 
- quanta - the definite packets of energy emitted when an electron changes orbits
- ground state - the lowest energy state of a particle.
- The Bohr model of the atom - electrons orbit the nucleus in specific orbits and can move from one orbit to another by gaining or emitting energy. This makes no sense. Why can't the electron orbit between N=1 and N=2 orbits and how does it go from one to another?
- atoms are mostly made up of empty space. The electron orbit's radius (n = 1) is 60,000 times bigger than the radius of a proton
- The Bohr model isn't completely correct. More on that later.
- Spectroscopy - [video](https://youtu.be/n_KyYFYNvpI) - Identifying chemicals by studying the light they emit or absorb
- spectra - patterns of light emitted/absorbed from/to atoms
- absorbtion spectroscopy - studying the spectra absorbed by atoms
- emission spectroscopy - studying the spectra emitted by atoms

## Examples
CC9 - electron moves from n=2 orbit of H to n=1 orbit. &lamda; = 122nm. Suppose the electron moves to n=5 orbit. When it comes back to n=1 orbit, will the wavelength of light it emits be longer or shorter than 122nm?
- Obviously 5-1 (the second jump) is bigger than 2-1 (the first jump that was 122nm)
- So, it will emit more energy. Bigger jump means more energy. In this case emitted.
- But wavelengths are inversly proportional to frequency and thus energy. 
- Let me explain. We know f = c/&lambda; and E = h * f
- If we combine these we get: E = h * c / &lambda;
- So, E = something/&lambda; 
- This means that Energy is on the top and &lambda; is on the bottom. So they are inversly proportional. If E gets bigger, &lambda; must get smaller. And if &lambda; gets bigger, E must get smaller.
- In this problem E grew 1 orbit diefference to 4 orbits diefference (much bigger), this means that &lambda; (the wavelength) must get smaller.
- So, the new wavelength should be less than 122nm (which is a **shorter** wavelength)
