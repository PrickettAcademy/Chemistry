## Notes

- **Chemical symbols** - abbreviations used to represent the elements on the periodic table. In most cases, this is the first 2 letters of its english or latin name.
- The Periodic Table of the Elements or periodic table is an arrangement of the known elements in groupings by their properties. It contains a large amount of information.
- **Atomic number** - the number of protons in the element. This number is at the top of the box for the element.
- **Atomic mass units** - (amu) the mass of a single atom of the element. 1 amu = 1.66 x 10<sup>-24</sup>g
- I should know elements represented by the following abbreviations:
  - H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, 
  - O, F, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, 
  - P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca, Sc
- All *neutrally charged* atoms have equal numbers of protons and elections
- **Mass number** - the number of neutrons plus protons in an isotope of an element. This can be written as <sup>14</sup>C or as C-14, but the first one is more common.
- An isotope with more neutrons is heavier than an isotope with fewer neutrons.
- The atomic mass of an element listed on the periodic table is a weighted average of the masses of all common isotopes. This means that the most common isotopes make up a bigger part of the average than the rarer isotopes.
- **Radioactive decay** - The spontaneous breakdown of an atom's nucleus, which often changes the element to which the atom belongs.
- **Radioactive isotope** - Some isotopes of elements are stable and some are not. Unstable isotopes like C-14 will decay into other elements.
- **Chain reaction** - [video](https://youtu.be/0v8i4v1mieU) - A fission reaction if left unchecked will continue to grow causing a chain reaction and can produce a powerful explosion.
- **Isotopic enrichment** - A process of extacting certain isotopes of an element. This is not a chemical process since these are isotopes.
- **Nuclear power** - power plants that use fission reactions to produce heat and energy. If a nuclear power plant runs out of control it causes a **meltdown** (not an explosion).
- **Light Waves** - Light travels in waves. Each wave has a crest and a trough.
- **Wavelength** - distance from one crest of a wave to the next crest. (or trough to trough)
- **Amplitude** - distance from the top of the crest to the middle of the wave (or the distance from there to the botttom of the trough).
- **frequency** - The fequency of light is calculated as *f* = c/&lambda; where f stands for frequency; c stands for the speed of light; and &lambda; stands for the wavelength of the light.
- **Hertz (Hz)** - the units for frequency. 1 Hz = 1/sec
- Wavelengths are usually measured in nm (namometers). 1 nm = 10<sup>-9</sup>m
- The electromagnetic spectrum - The is the name for all the wavelengths of light including the visible light that we can see.
- Gamma rays have a high frequency, short wavelength, and lots of energy
- Long radio waves have a low frequency, long wavelength, and very little energy
- Energy is measure in Joules (J).
- The energy in a single photon of light is calculated by the equation E = h * f where E is the energy; h is a constant; and f is the frequency of the light. As the frequency grows so does the energy.
- The constant **h** is called Plank's constant and is equal to 6.63 * 10<sup>-34</sup> J * sec

## Examples
CC5. What is the wavelength of violet light, which has a frequency of 7.89 * 10<sup>14</sup>Hz
- First, remember the equation: f = c/&lambda;
- Now, rearrange it so that &lambda; is on the left side (using algebra). &lambda; = c/f 
- We were given c = 3.00 * 10<sup>8</sup> m/sec
- So, &lambda; = 3.00 * 10<sup>8</sup> m/sec / 7.89 * 10<sup>14</sup>Hz  = 3.80 * 10<sup>-7</sup>m
- Note that Hz and sec cancel out because Hz = 1/sec
- Now convert it to nm. 3.80 * 10<sup>-7</sup>m * 10<sup>9</sup>nm/m = **3.80 * 10<sup>2</sup>nm**
- Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/dpPgsgWq9CQ) on how to do these problems if you want more practice

CC8. What is the wavelength of a photon with an energy of 6.81 * 10<sup>-17</sup>J?
- First, remember the equation: E = h * f where h is Plank's constant
- Fill in what we know: 6.81 * 10<sup>-17</sup>J = 6.63 * 10<sup>-34</sup> J * sec * f
- Solve for f: f = 6.81 * 10<sup>-17</sup>J / 6.63 * 10<sup>-34</sup> J * sec
- The J's cancel so the units will end up as 1/sec or Hz
- f = 1.03 * 10<sup>17</sup> Hz (but that's the frequency not the wavelength - we aren't done)
- Remember the equation: f = c/&lambda;
- Now, rearrange it so that &lambda; is on the left side (using algebra). &lambda; = c/f 
- Fill in what we know: &lambda; = 3.00 * 10<sup>8</sup> m/sec / 1.03 * 10<sup>17</sup> Hz
- Solve for &lambda; 
- the /sec and Hz cancel each other out since Hz is 1/sec
- &lambda; = 2.91 * 10<sup>-9</sup>m
- converting to nm:  &lambda; = 2.91 * 10<sup>-9</sup> m * 10<sup>9</sup>nm / 1m = **2.91nm**
