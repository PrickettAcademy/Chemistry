## Notes

- **Chemical symbols** - abbreviations used to represent the elements on the periodic table. In most cases, this is the first 2 letters of its english or latin name.
- The Periodic Table of the Elements or periodic table is an arrangement of the known elements in groupings by their properties. It contains a large amount of information.
- **Atomic number** - the number of protons in the element. This number is at the top of the box for the element.
- **Atomic mass units** - (amu) the mass of a single atom of the element. 1 amu = 1.66 x 10<sup>-24</sup>g
- I should know elements represented by the following abbreviations:
  - H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, 
  - O, F, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, 
  - P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca, Sc
- All *neutrally charged* atoms have equal numbers of protons and elections
- **Mass number** - the number of neutrons plus protons in an isotope of an element. This can be written as <sup>14</sup>C or as C-14, but the first one is more common.
- An isotope with more neutrons is heavier than an isotope with fewer neutrons.
- The atomic mass of an element listed on the periodic table is a weighted average of the masses of all common isotopes. This means that the most common isotopes make up a bigger part of the average than the rarer isotopes.
- **Radioactive decay** - The spontaneous breakdown of an atom's nucleus, which often changes the element to which the atom belongs.
- **Radioactive isotope** - Some isotopes of elements are stable and some are not. Unstable isotopes like C-14 will decay into other elements.
- **Chain reaction** - A fission reaction if left unchecked will continue to grow causing a chain reaction and can produce a powerful explosion.
- **Isotopic enrichment** - A process of extacting certain isotopes of an element. This is not a chemical process since these are isotopes.
- **Nuclear power** - power plants that use fission reactions to produce heat and energy. If a nuclear power plant runs out of control it causes a **meltdown** (not an explosion).
- **Light Waves** - Light travels in waves. Each wave has a crest and a trough.
- **Wavelength** - distance from one crest of a wave to the next crest. (or trough to trough)
- **frequency** - The fequency of light is calculated as *f* = c/y
