## Notes

- Molarity is commonly used in stoichiometry to mix the right amount of solutions together based on a chemical equation.
- Molalility is another measurement for concentration, but it is very different from Molarity.
- Formula for Molalility is moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
- dissolving a solute in a solvent lowers its freezing point and raises its boiling point.
- freezing point depression is given by this formula: 	&#916;T = -iKm where 	&#916;T is the change in freezing point, i is the number of particles of solute in the solution, K is a constant based on solvent and m is the molality of the solution.
- boiling point elevation is given by a similar formula: &#916;T = iKm where 	&#916;T is the change in boiling point, i is the number of particles of solute in the solution, K is a **different** constant based on solvent and m is the molality of the solution.

## Examples

CC7. Given MgCl<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> --> MgCO<sub>3</sub> + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. What volume of 1.5 M solution of magnesium chloride do you need to make 450.0 grams of magnesium carbonate?
- First you need to remember your polyatomic ions.
