## Notes

- Molarity is commonly used in stoichiometry to mix the right amount of solutions together based on a chemical equation.
- Molality is another measurement for concentration, but it is very different from Molarity.
- Formula for Molality is moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
- dissolving a solute in a solvent lowers its freezing point and raises its boiling point.
- freezing point depression is given by this formula: 	&#916;T = -iKm where 	&#916;T is the change in freezing point, i is the number of particles of solute in the solution, K is a constant based on solvent and m is the molality of the solution.
- boiling point elevation is given by a similar formula: &#916;T = iKm where 	&#916;T is the change in boiling point, i is the number of particles of solute in the solution, K is a **different** constant based on solvent and m is the molality of the solution.

## Examples

CC7. Given MgCl<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> --> MgCO<sub>3</sub> + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. What volume of 1.5 M solution of magnesium chloride do you need to make 450.0 grams of magnesium carbonate?
- First, how many moles of MgCO<sub>3</sub> is in 450.0 g? 
- Molar mass of MgCO<sub>3</sub> is 24.31 + 12.01 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84.32 g/mol
- 450.0 g MgCO<sub>3</sub> * 1 mol / 84.32 g = 5.337 moles MgCO<sub>3</sub>
- The relationship of MgCO<sub>3</sub> to MgCl<sub>2</sub> is 1 mole to 1 mole according to the equation. So, we need 5.337 moles of MgCl<sub>2</sub> as well.
- Since MgCl<sub>2</sub> is in a 1.5 M solution we need to convert the number of moles to liters.
- Remember that M = moles/liter. So, the solution is 1.5 moles of MgCl<sub>2</sub> / 1 liter of solution
- So, 5.337 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> * 1 L / 1.5 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> = **3.6 L of MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution**

CC9. What's the molality of 125.0 g KBr dissolved in 750.0 g of water?
- Molality is moles of solute / kilograms of solvent so we have some conversions to do.
- Molar mass of KBr is 39.10 + 79.90 = 119.00 g/mol
- 125.0 g KBr * 1 mol / 119.00 g = 1.050 mol KBr
- 750.0 g water * 1 kg / 1000 g = 0.7500 kg water
- molality = 1.050 mol / 0.7500 kg = **1.400 m**

CC10. how many grams of Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> do you need to make a 0.75 m solution with 350.0 g of water?
- Molar mass of Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = 87.62 + (14.01 + 16 + 16 + 16) * 2 = 211.64 g/mol
- Molality is moles of solute / kilograms of solvent. So 0.75 m = X / 0.3500 kg. X = 0.75 mol/kg * 0.3500 kg = 0.26 moles of solute
- 0.26 mol * 211.64 g/mol = **55 g Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>**

CC11. What is the freezing point of 500.0 g of acetic acid with 50.0 g of glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) dissolved in it? K<sub>i</sub> = 3.90 <sup>o</sup>C/m. freezing point of just acetic acid 16.6 <sup>o</sup>C
- remember the formula. &#916;T = -iKm 
- We are given K; i must be 1 since glucose doesn't appear to be an ion that we know; but we need to calculate m (molality)
- m = moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
- molar mass of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> = 12.01 * 6 + 1.01 * 12 + 16.00 * 6 = 180.18 g/mol
- moles of glucose = 50.0 g * 1 mol / 180.18 g = 0.278 mol
- m = 0.278 mol / 0.5000 kg = 0.556 m
- &#916;T = -1 * 3.90 <sup>o</sup>C/m * 0.556 m = -2.17 <sup>o</sup>C. but that's not the answer. The question was what is the new freezing point. That's just the change.
- freezing point of solution = 16.6 <sup>o</sup>C - 2.17 <sup>o</sup>C = **14.4 <sup>o</sup>C**
