## Notes

- Molalility is another measurement for concentration, but it is very different from Molarity.
- Formula for Molalility is moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
- dissolving a solute in a solvent lowers its freezing point and raises its boiling point.
- freezing point depression is given by this formula: 	&#916;T = -iKm where 	&#916;T is the change in freezing point, i is the number of particles of solute in the solution, K is a constant based on solvent and m is the molality of the solution.
