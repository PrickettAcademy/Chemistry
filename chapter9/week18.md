## Notes

- Molarity is commonly used in stoichiometry to mix the right amount of solutions together based on a chemical equation.
- Molalility is another measurement for concentration, but it is very different from Molarity.
- Formula for Molalility is moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
- dissolving a solute in a solvent lowers its freezing point and raises its boiling point.
- freezing point depression is given by this formula: 	&#916;T = -iKm where 	&#916;T is the change in freezing point, i is the number of particles of solute in the solution, K is a constant based on solvent and m is the molality of the solution.
- boiling point elevation is given by a similar formula: &#916;T = iKm where 	&#916;T is the change in boiling point, i is the number of particles of solute in the solution, K is a **different** constant based on solvent and m is the molality of the solution.

## Examples

CC7. Given MgCl<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> --> MgCO<sub>3</sub> + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. What volume of 1.5 M solution of magnesium chloride do you need to make 450.0 grams of magnesium carbonate?
- First, how many moles of MgCO<sub>3</sub> is in 450.0 g? 
- Molar mass of MgCO<sub>3</sub> is 24.31 + 12.01 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84.32 g/mol
- 450.0 g MgCO<sub>3</sub> * 1 mol / 84.32 g = 5.337 moles MgCO<sub>3</sub>
- The relationship of MgCO<sub>3</sub> to MgCl<sub>2</sub> is 1 mole to 1 mole according to the equation. So, we need 5.337 moles of MgCl<sub>2</sub> as well.
- Since MgCl<sub>2</sub> is in a 1.5 M solution we need to convert the number of moles to liters.
- Remember that M = moles/liter. So, the solution is 1.5 moles of MgCl<sub>2</sub> / 1 liter of solution
- So, 5.337 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> * 1 liter / 1.5 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> = **3.6 liters of MgCl<sub>2</sub>**
