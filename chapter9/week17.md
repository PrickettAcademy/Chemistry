## Notes

- Solution - a homogeneous mixture of 2 or more substances. These can be solids, liquids, or gases.
- Solute - the substance or substances dissolved into a solution
- Solvent - the substance into which solutes are dissolved.
- When ionic compounds dissolve, they split up into their individual ions. If dissovled in water this can make the water conduct electricity.
- When polar covalent compounds dissolve, they split up into their individual molecules. This does not help water conduct electricity.


## Examples

CC1. identify what's in the following solutions (compound is dissolved in water)
- K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> - CO<sub>3</sub> is carbonate an ionic compound with a -2 charge. So, this will split up into K<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> ions and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions surrounded by H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. The solution conducts electricity because it is an ionic compound dissoved in water.
- CS<sub>2</sub> - This is a covalent molecule, so it will not split up and will not conduct electricity.
- C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - This doesn't appear to be any ionic compound that we know, so it must be a covalent molecule. So it will not split up and will not conduct electricity. 
- NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> - NH<sub>4</sub> is ammonium with a +1 charge and NO<sub>3</sub> is nitrate with a -1 charge. So this is ionic and will conduct electricity. The solution contains NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ions, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, surrounded by H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.
