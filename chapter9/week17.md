## Notes

- Solution - a homogeneous mixture of 2 or more substances. These can be solids, liquids, or gases.
- Solute - the substance or substances dissolved into a solution
- Solvent - the substance into which solutes are dissolved.
- When ionic compounds dissolve, they split up into their individual ions. If dissovled in water this can make the water conduct electricity. [quick video that animates this concept](https://youtu.be/EBfGcTAJF4o)
- When polar covalent compounds dissolve, they split up into their individual molecules. This does not help water conduct electricity.
- Solubility - the amount of solute that can be dissolved in a specific amount of solution. This is expressed as grams of solute in 100 grams of solvent.
- solubility is affected by temperature. You can dissolve more sugar in hot water than in the same amount of cold water.
- the solubility of gas solutes *decreases* with increasing temperature.
- the solubility of most solid solutes *increases* with increasing temperature.
- Saturated solution - a solution in which the maximum amount of solute is dissolved.
- the solubility of gas solutes *increases* with increasing pressure.
- precipitate - a solid that emerges from a liquid solution.
- concentration - the amount of substance in a defined volume.
- the behavior of a chemical often depends on concentration.
- molarity - moles of solute over liters of solution. This is usually moles/liter which is abbreviated as "M" (uppercase).

## Examples

CC1. identify what's in the following solutions (compound is dissolved in water)
- K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> - CO<sub>3</sub> is carbonate an ionic compound with a -2 charge. K is in column 1A so it's ion is +1. So, this will split up into 2 K<sup>+</sup> ions and 1 CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ion surrounded by H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. The solution conducts electricity because it is an ionic compound dissoved in water.
- CS<sub>2</sub> - This is a covalent molecule, so it will not split up and will not conduct electricity.
- C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - This doesn't appear to be any ionic compound that we know, so it must be a covalent molecule. So it will not split up and will not conduct electricity. 
- NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> - NH<sub>4</sub> is ammonium with a +1 charge and NO<sub>3</sub> is nitrate with a -1 charge. So this is ionic and will conduct electricity. The solution contains NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ions, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, surrounded by H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.

CC2. starting with a saturated solution of ammonia (gas solute)
- a. if temp decreases - nothing really changes, but the solution is no longer saturated because you could now dissolve even more ammonia gas in the solvent.
- b. if pressure decreases - some of the ammonia gas will leave the solution, but the solution is still saturated.

CC3. how to make a solution of sodium bromide (solid solute) saturated without adding more sodium bromide
- To ensure that it is saturated, we need to decrease the solubility until some of the soduim bromide leaves the solution. Since it's a solid solute, we just need to decrease the temperature of the solution until some leaves the solution. At that point the solution is saturated.

CC4. Calcium Phosphate is insoluable in water. If a solution of potassium phosphate is mixed with a solution of calcium chloride, what is the chemical equation?
- Calcium is Ca in column 2A whose ion has a +2 charge and phosphate is PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. So the chemical formula for calcium phosphate is Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.
- Potassium is K in 1A whose ion has a +1 charge. So, potassium phosphate has a formula of K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.
- The formula for calcium chloride is CaCl<sub>2</sub> because Cl is in column 7A whose ion has a -1 charge.
- That should leave potassium and chlorine to combine in the reactants with the formla KCl which I assume dissolves in water.
- So, the unbalanced equation is K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (aq) + CaCl<sub>2</sub> (aq) --> Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (s) + KCl (aq)
- Balanced: 2K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (aq) + 3CaCl<sub>2</sub> (aq) --> Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (s) + 6KCl (aq)

CC5. what's the molarity of 15.67 grams of ammonium carbonate in 200.0 ml of solution?
- First remember the formula M = moles/liter 
- So, we need the number of moles of ammonium carbonate. The formula for this is (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. These are both ions that we should know ammonium has +1 charge and carbonate has a -2 charge.
- Now we can figure out the molar mass of the molecule: (14.01 * 2) + (1.01 * 8) + 12.01 + (16 * 3) = 96.11 g/mol
- That gives us a way to get the number of moles from the grams given: 15.67g * (1 mol / 96.11 g) = 0.1630 moles
- Don't forget to convert the mililiters into liters: 1 liter = 1000 ml
- 200.0 ml * (1 liter / 1000 ml) = 0.2000 liters
- So the molarity is 0.1630 moles / 0.2000 liters = 0.8150 mol/liter or **0.8150 M**

CC6. If we use 34.2 mL of the CC5 solution, how many moles of ammonium carbonate are used?
- This is actually easy because we know the molarity of the solution: 0.8150 mol/liter
- So, lets first convert 34.2 mL into L: 34.2 mL * (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.0342 L
- Now we just multiply: 0.0342 L * 0.8150 mol/L = **0.0279 moles**
