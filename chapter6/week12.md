## Notes

- While balancing a chemical equation, you can change the numbers to the left of the molecules (reactants or products) as mush as you want. You just can't change the subscripts (little numbers) in the chemical formulas.
- The fact that an element is a homonuclear diatomic is only important if it is not in a compound and not an ion.

- **Formation reaction** - A reaction in which 2 or more elements react together to form a single compound.
- **Decompition reaction** - A reaction in which the only reactant is a compound and the products are the elements from which the compound is made.
- **Single displacement reaction** - A reaction in which one element or ion in a compound is replaced by a different element or ion.
- **Double displacement reaction** - A reaction in which 2 elements or ions in 2 different compounds switch places, each becoming part of the other compound.
- **Combustion reaction** -The process by which a chemical reacts with oxygen to form one or more products as well as heat and usually light.
- **Complete combustion** - A combustion reaction in which the only products are carbon dioxide and water.
- **Incomplete combustion** - A combustion reaction in which carbon monoxide and/or elemental carbon are formed in addition to water. 
- Remember that just because something seems to burn or explode, doesn't make the reaction a combustion reaction. By the definition above a combustion reaction is one where a compound or element reacts with **oxygen**.


## Examples

CC7. show the chemical equation for N gas and H gas reacting to make nitrogen trihydride gas.
- First, remember that N and H are homonuclear diatomic molecules when they are elements. So, the reactants are N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.
- Next, we need to decipher the product. Using the naming rules, there must be just one N in the molecule and 3 H's. That means the product is NH<sub>3</sub>.
- So, we can start with N<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> --> NH<sub>3</sub> (not balanced)
- But now we have to balance the equation. 
- The product has 3 times the hydrogen than the nitrogen. So, let's fix the ratio of the reactants. N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> --> NH<sub>3</sub> (not balanced)
- But because N and H come in 2's, we need to update the products to have 2 N's as well. N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> --> 2NH<sub>3</sub> 
- If we check that now, reactants are N=2 H=6 and products are N=2 H=6, so we are balanced.
- **N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) --> 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g)** 

CC8. balance how C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> combines with O<sub>2</sub> to produce CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O
- Start with C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> --> CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
- Reactants C=3 H=8 O=2, products C=1 H=2 O=3. We to increase the product side C to 3 and the H to 8 (remeber that H has a subscript of 2)
- Now we have C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> --> **3**CO<sub>2</sub> + **4**H<sub>2</sub>O
- Reactants C=3 H=8 O=2, products C=3 H=8 O=10. So, we just need more O's on the reactants. Let's increase those to 10.
- Now we have C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> + **5**O<sub>2</sub> --> 3CO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O
- Double check the counts: Reactants C=3 H=8 O=10, products C=3 H=8 O=10 - THEY MATCH!
- balanced: **C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(g) + 5O<sub>2</sub>(g) --> 3CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O(g)**

CC9. balance H<sub>2</sub> + CO --> C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
- Reactants H=2 C=1 O=1, products C=8 H=(18+2)=20 O=1. Since the numbers are pretty big, let's take it slow. Let's increase the C's on the reactant side first to 8.
- H<sub>2</sub> + **8**CO --> C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
- Reactants H=2 C=8 O=8, products C=8 H=(18+2)=20 O=1. Now, let's work on increasing the O's on the product side to 8 and then see where H is off.
- H<sub>2</sub> + 8CO --> C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + **8**H<sub>2</sub>O
- Reactants H=2 C=8 O=8, products C=8 H=(18+16)=34 O=8. Finally, let's work on the H's, we need to increase the reactants side to 34.
- **17**H<sub>2</sub> + 8CO --> C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O
- double check the numbers: reactants H=34 C=8 O=8, products C=8 H=(18+16)=34 O=8. we are balanced!
- **17H<sub>2</sub>(g) + 8CO(g) --> C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>(g) + 8H<sub>2</sub>O(g)**

CC12. show the balanced chemical equation for the formation of HNO<sub>3</sub>
- To get started, you need to notice the word *formation* in the question and remember the definiton of a formation equation. Basically, it's one where **elements** are combines to **form** a single compound.
- So, this equation should have elements on the left and one compound on the right. Of course, some of those elements may be homonuclear diatomic molecules (like H, N, and O)
- So, you might start with this: H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> --> HNO<sub>3</sub>
- Now we have to balance it. There's 2 of each element on the left which means we should probably have 2 molecules on the right at least.
- H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> --> **2**HNO<sub>3</sub> - That fixes the H and the N, but not the O's. We now have 6 O's on the right and only 2 on the left. But, that's easy to fix...
- H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> + **3**O<sub>2</sub> --> 2HNO<sub>3</sub>
- Double check the counts: reactants: H=2 N=2 O=6  products: H=2 N=2 O=6 -- We are balanced!
- **H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> + 3O<sub>2</sub> --> 2HNO<sub>3</sub>**
