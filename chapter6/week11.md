## Notes

- **Physical change** - a change which does not alter the chemical composition of a substance. Examplle: water boiling or freezing.
- **Chemical change** - a change that alters the chemical compositiion of a substance. Example: wood burning.

- Physical changes are fairly easy to reverse, while checmical changes are much harder or impossible to reverse.
- Temperature is usually measured in Celcius in chemistry. Converting from Farenheit to Celsius is fairly simple. You just need to remember the freezing and boiling points in both. Celcius is 0<sup>o</sup> and 100<sup>o</sup>. Farenheit is 32<sup>o</sup> and 212<sup>o</sup>. Here's the formula: F = (212-32)/(100-0) * C + 32. If you simply it, you will see that it is the same as in the book: F = 9/5 * C + 32. The 9/5 fraction comes from the ratio of the difference between the boiling points and the freezing points.
- There are 4 phases of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. (we won't be dealing with plasma)
- We use the following terms for phase changes: melting, vaporizing, condensing, and freezing.
- Usually, solids melt into liquids and the vaporize into gases, but some compounds go direction from solids to gases. This is called **sublimation**.
- Volumes are not necessarily additive (remember when we added water to alcohol. Mass is always additive.
- **Kinetic theory of matter** - the molecules or atoms that make up a substance have space in between them, and they are in constant, random motion. The hotter the substance, the faster the motion.
- A heating curve for a particular substance has flat areas where the substance melts and where it vaporizes.
- Most substances take up more space as they go from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas.
- Water is an important exception to this. Frozen water takes up more space than liquid water. This is important to life in the water.

- Chemical reactions are represented as equations with **reactants** on the left and **products** on the right and an arrow in the middle instead of an equals sign.
- A chemical equation is considered balanced if the number of each reactant on the left matches the number and kind of atoms in the products.

## Examples

CC2. Convert -76<sup>o</sup>F to Celcius.
- First, remember the equation: F = 9/5 * C + 32
- Now, fill in what we know: -76 = 9/5 * C + 32
- Solve for C: C = (-76 - 32) * 5/9
- So, C = -60<sup>o</sup> Celcius

CC6. Are these equations balanced?
1. 4FeS + 7O<sub>2</sub> --> 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4SO<sub>2</sub>
  - First, we need to count the number of each atom on the left: Fe=4 S=4 O=14
  - Next, we count the number of each atom on the right: Fe=4 S=4 O=14
  - **YES**, it is not balanced
2. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O + 4O<sub>2</sub> --> 2CO<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
  - First, the left side: C=2 H=6 O=9
  - Next, the right side: C=2 H=6 O=7
  - **NO**, it is not balanced
