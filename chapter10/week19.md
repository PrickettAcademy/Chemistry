## Notes

- Pressure is an important property of gases.
- Pressure is defined as Force / Area. It is measured in units called Pascals named after Blaise Pascal.
- In Chemistry, we commonly use another unit for pressure called atmospheres (atm). 1 atm = 101,325 Pascals. 1 atm is the average amount of pressure exerted by the air at sea level.
- In Meteorology, they often use distance to measure pressure because they are using barometers. 
- Another commonly used measurement for pressure is a torr. 1 atm = 760 torr.
- Boyle's Law - at a constant temperature, pressure and volume are inversly proportional to one another. P<sub>1</sub> * V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub> * V<sub>2</sub>
- Charles Law - at a constant pressure, temperature and volume are directly proportional to one another. (V<sub>1</sub> / T<sub>1</sub>) = (V<sub>2</sub> / T<sub>2</sub>)
- The Kelvin temperature scale is the same as Celcius if you subtract 273.15 degrees from the measurement. K = <sup>o</sup>C + 273.15
- We always use the Kelvin scale for temperature in these gas equations!
- The Combined Gas Law - (P<sub>1</sub> * V<sub>1</sub>) / T<sub>1</sub> = (P<sub>2</sub> * V<sub>2</sub>) / T<sub>2</sub>

## Examples

CC1. what is 750.1 torr in atm? Is it more or less than 1 atm?
- This is simple conversion: 750.1 torr * 1 atm / 760 torr = **0.9870 atm which is less than 1 atm**

CC2. what is 156.7 K in degrees C and degrees F?
- More conversion: the conversion from K to C is simple - subtract 273.15. Then you can use your C to F conversion equation.
- 156.7 - 273.15 <sup>o</sup>C = **-116.5 <sup>o</sup>C**
- 116.5 <sup>o</sup>C * (9 <sup>o</sup>F / 5 <sup>o</sup>C) + 32 = **-177.7 <sup>o</sup>F**

CC3. temp = constant, volume1 = 150.1 mL, volume2 = 75.6 mL, pressure1 = 750 torr, what is pressure2?
- since temp is constant, we can cancel that off both sides of the equation by multiplying both sides by T (temp1 and temp2 are the same).
- So, the gas law equation looks like this: P1 * V1 = P2 * V2
- First, convert to right units on all these numbers, i.e. from mL to L and from torr to atm (technically, the units that we don't want cancel out, so this isn't needed, but it's always good to use the same units in calculations.
- volume1 = 0.1501 L, volume2 = 0.0756 L, pressure1 = 750 torr * (1 atm / 760 torr) = 0.99 atm
- Fill in what we know: 0.99 atm * 0.1501 L = P<sub>2</sub> * 0.0756 L
- Solve for P<sub>2</sub> = 0.99 atm * 0.1501 L / 0.0756 L = **2.0 atm**

CC4. volume1 = 3.91 L, pressure1 = 1.09 atm, temp1 = 28.4 <sup>o</sup>C, pressure2 = 3.70 atm, volume2 = 1.09 L, what is temp2
- This time only the temperature is in the wrong units: 28.4 <sup>o</sup>C + 273.15 = 301.6 K
- remember the formula: (P<sub>1</sub> * V<sub>1</sub>) / T<sub>1</sub> = (P<sub>2</sub> * V<sub>2</sub>) / T<sub>2</sub>
- Fill in what we know: 1.09 atm * 3.91 L / 301.6 K = 3.70 atm * 1.09 L / T<sub>2</sub>
- Solve for T<sub>2</sub>. This may seem hard because T<sub>2</sub> is on the bottom of a fraction, but you can simply cross multiply to move the T's on top. If we did this first the formula would look like this: (P<sub>1</sub> * V<sub>1</sub>) * T<sub>2</sub> = (P<sub>2</sub> * V<sub>2</sub>) * T<sub>1</sub>. Notice how the T's swapped sides and moved to the top. This is called cross multiplying.
- So, 1.09 atm * 3.91 L * T<sub>2</sub> = 3.70 atm * 1.09 L * 301.6 K
- T<sub>2</sub> = (3.70 atm * 1.09 L * 301.6 K) / (1.09 atm * 3.91 L) = 285 K
- But they asked for <sup>o</sup>C. 285K - 273.15 = 12 <sup>o</sup>C
