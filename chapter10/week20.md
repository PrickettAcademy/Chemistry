## Notes

- Avagadro's law - Equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules/atoms.
- When all substances of interest are gases, as long as pressure and temperature remain the same, the chemical equation gives you the relationship between the volumes of those gases.
- The total pressure of a mixture of gases (that don't chemically interact) is the sum of the pressure of each individual gas.
- mole fraction - X = moles of component A / total moles in the mixture
- X also equals pressure of gas A / total pressure of the mixture.
- Vapor pressure is pressure exerted by water in a gas mixture. You can look up these values in the table in the book.

CC8. Given N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> --> 2NH<sub>3</sub>. if you are limited by 150.0 liters of N<sub>2</sub> what will be the volume of NH<sub>3</sub>?
- Remember that because they are all gases the ratio of their volumes is the same as the ratio of their moles.
- The ratio of N<sub>2</sub> to NH<sub>3</sub> is 1 N<sub>2</sub> / 2 NH<sub>3</sub>
- So, we can just do the conversion: 150.0 L N<sub>2</sub> * 2 NH<sub>3</sub> / 1 N<sub>2</sub> = **300.0 L NH<sub>3</sub>**

CC10. in a mixture of 2 gases, the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> is 341 torr, while the partial pressure of N<sub>2</sub> is 761 torr. If there are a total of 6.78 moles of gas, how many moles of oxygen and nitrogen are present?
- The mole fraction of O<sub>2</sub> is 341 torr / (341 + 761) torr = 0.309
- Now we use the other form of mole fraction: X = moles of O<sub>2</sub> / total number of moles
- 0.309 = moles of oxygen / 6.78 moles --> O = 0.309 * 6.78 moles = **2.10 moles O<sub>2</sub>**
- Now we do the same for nitrogen
- mole fraction of N<sub>2</sub> is 761 torr / (341 + 761) torr = 0.691
- 0.691 = moles of nitrogen / 6.78 moles --> N = 0.691 * 6.78 moles = **4.68 moles N<sub>2</sub>**
