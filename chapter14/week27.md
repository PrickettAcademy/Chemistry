## Notes

- spontaneous reaction - a reaction that occurs as soon as you properly put the reactants in contact with one another.
- Enthalpy - in chemistry this can be thought of as the measure of potential energy in a chemical system.
- Change in Enthalpy - &#916;H - the energy change that accompanies a chemical or physical change.
- For exothermic reactions, &#916;H is negative. For endothermic reactions, &#916;H is positive.
- &#916;H = (Energy for breaking bonds) - (Energy from making bonds)
- Bond Energy - the energy required to break a mole of a gien typ of bond. See the table in the book.
- enthalpy is a state function which means is doesn't matter how the reactants eventually became the products. This allows us to ignore how the reaction takes place and just focus on the initial and final states to get the change in enthalpy.
- The book has a table of the standard enthalpies of formation that allows us to quickly determine change in enthalpy.
- standard enthalpy of formation is abbreviated &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup>
- standard enthalpy of formation for any element in its natural phase is 0 kJ/nole. For instance, gaseous O<sub>2</sub> has a standard enthalpy of 0.
- Hess's Law - given aA + bB --> cC + dD then &#916;H = c * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (C) + d * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (D) - a * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (A) - b * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (B)
- activation energy - The energy to initiate a chemical reaction. All reactions require some activation energy. However, that energy may be readily available in the system.
- We need to understand a reaction coordinate diagram. See the book.
- thermodynamics - the study of the relationships and conversion between different forms of energy.
- first law of thermodynamics - energy cannot be created or destroyed. it can only change form.
- Entropy - a measure of the amount of energy in a system that is not available to do work.
- second law of thermodynamics - the entropy of the universe can never decrease. It must always stay the same or increase.
- the more atoms/molecules are moving, the more entropy the system has.

## Examples

CC1. 3 reactions are measured; identify each as exothermic or endothermic; which is the hottest?
- &#916;H = -1.73 kJ/mole - negative means it is exothermic
- &#916;H = 5.14 kJ/mole - positive means it is endothermic
- &#916;H = -16.8 kJ/mole - negative means it is exothermic; lowest number so it's the hottest.

CC2. determine &#916;H for CO + H<sub>2</sub>O --> CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
- First identify the bonds being broken: CO has a triple bond and there are 2 H-O single bonds
- The bond energy of the bonds being broken then is (using the table in the book) 1072 + 460 + 460 = 1992
- Now identify the bonds being created: CO<sub>2</sub> is made up of 2 double bonds of CO and there is an H-H single bond
- So the total bond energy is 732 + 732 + 436 = 1900
- &#916;H = (Energy for breaking bonds) - (Energy from making bonds)
- &#916;H = 1992 - 1900 = **92 kJ/mole which is endothermic**

CC3. find &#916;H for HCl (g) + NH<sub>3</sub> (g) --> NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (s)
- The coeffecients are all 1 which makes this a bit easier, but I will put in the 1's for completeness
- &#916;H = 1 * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) - 1 * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (HCl) - 1 * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (NH<sub>3</sub>)
- &#916;H = 1 * (-314.6) - 1 * (-92.3) - 1 * (-45.9) = **-176.4 kJ/mole**

CC4. find &#916;H for the complete combustion of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (g)
- complete combustion means that the reaction is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> --> H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>
- Note that all of these reactants and products are gases at 25 degrees C. Even water is a gas because we are doing combustion.
- but we need to balance that first: 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (g) + 7O<sub>2</sub> (g) --> 6H<sub>2</sub>O (g) + 4CO<sub>2</sub> (g)
- now we can use Hess's Law with the right coefficients
- &#916;H = 6 * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (H<sub>2</sub>O) + 4 * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (CO<sub>2</sub>) - 2 * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) - 7 * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (O<sub>2</sub>)
- Using the table we can substitute in the &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> values
- &#916;H = 6 * (-241.8) + 4 * (-393.5) - 2 * (-84.7) - 7 * (0) = **-2855.4 kJ/mole**

CC5. how much energy is produced when 250.0 g of methane is burned in excess oxygen?
- Given: CH<sub>4</sub> (g) + 2O<sub>2</sub> (g) --> CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (g)
- First, we need to know &#916;H so we can add it to the reaction equation
- &#916;H = -393.5 + 2 * (-241.8) - (-74.9) - 2 * (0) = -802.2 kJ/mole
- &#916;H is negative which means this is exothermic, so the energy is produced by the reaction and should be on the products side
- CH<sub>4</sub> (g) + 2O<sub>2</sub> (g) --> CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (g) + 802.2 kJ/mole
- Now let's figure out how many moles 250.0 g of methane is.
- molar mass = 12.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 = 16.05 g/mol
- So  250.0 g * 1 mol / 16.05 g = 15.58 mol of CH<sub>4</sub>
- The ratio of CH<sub>4</sub> to &#916;H is 1 mol of CH<sub>4</sub> / 802.2 kJ
- So 15.58 mol of CH<sub>4</sub> * 802.2 kJ / 1 mol of CH<sub>4</sub> = **12500 kJ**

CC6. see diagrams in book
- which one is endothermic? II is endothermic because it ends up with more potential energy than it started with.
- which one releases the most energy? III releases more energy because is starts at 400 and ends up at 200 releasing 2 times as much as I.
- which is easiest to start? I is easiest to start because the peak is only 200 from where the reaction starts.

CC7. What law of thermodynamics applies to calorimetry experiments?
- The first law of thermodynamics tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So, if we have a closed system like a calorimeter, we can assume that the energy from the hot metal will stay in the system and heat up the water and the calorimeter.

CC8. Which has higher entropy?
- 200 molecules at 200 degrees has higher entropy than 100 molecules at 100 degrees
- A mole of water vapor at 100 degrees has higher entropy than a mole of liquid water at 100 degrees
- 500 molecules of gas in a 2 liter container has higher entropy than in a 1 liter container at the same temp
