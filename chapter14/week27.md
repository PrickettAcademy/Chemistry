## Notes

- spontaneous reaction - a reaction that occurs as soon as you properly put the reactants in contact with one another.
- Enthalpy - in chemistry this can be thought of as the measure of potential energy in a chemical system.
- Change in Enthalpy - &#916;H - the energy change that accompanies a chemical or physical change.
- For exothermic reactions, &#916;H is negative. For endothermic reactions, &#916;H is positive.
- &#916;H = (Energy for breaking bonds) - (Energy from making bonds)
- Bond Energy - the energy required to break a mole of a gien typ of bond. See the table in the book.
- enthalpy is a state function which means is doesn't matter how the reactants eventually became the products. This allows us to ignore how the reaction takes place and just focus on the initial and final states to get the change in enthalpy.
- The book has a table of the standard enthalpies of formation that allows us to quickly determine change in enthalpy.
- standard enthalpy of formation is abbreviated &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup>
- standard enthalpy of formation for any element in its natural phase is 0 kJ/nole. For instance, gaseous O<sub>2</sub> has a standard enthalpy of 0.
- Hess's Law - given aA + bB --> cC + dD then &#916;H = c * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (C) + d * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (D) - a * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (A) - b * &#916;H<sub>f</sub><sup>o</sup> (B)

## Examples

CC1. 3 reactions are measured; identify each as exothermic or endothermic; which is the hottest?
- &#916;H = -1.73 kJ/mole - negative means it is exothermic
- &#916;H = 5.14 kJ/mole - positive means it is endothermic
- &#916;H = -16.8 kJ/mole - negative means it is exothermic; lowest number so it's the hottest.

CC2. determine &#916;H for CO + H<sub>2</sub>O --> CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
- First identify the bonds being broken: CO has a triple bond and there are 2 H-O single bonds
- The bond energy of the bonds being broken then is (using the table in the book) 1072 + 460 + 460 = 1992
- Now identify the bonds being created: CO<sub>2</sub> is made up of 2 double bonds of CO and there is an H-H single bond
- So the total bond energy is 732 + 732 + 436 = 1900
- &#916;H = (Energy for breaking bonds) - (Energy from making bonds)
- &#916;H = 1992 - 1900 = **92 kJ/mole which is endothermic**
