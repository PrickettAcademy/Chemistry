## Notes

- &#916;S<sub>system</sub> + &#916;S<sub>surroundings</sub> >= 0
- When calculating the sign of &#916;S use the following rules
  - The solid phase is the lowest-entropy phase, while the gas phase is the highest-entropy phase.
  - The larger the number of molecules, the higher the entropy
- Given aA + bB --> cC + dD ... &#916;S = c * S<sup>o</sup>(C) + d * S<sup>o</sup>(D) - a * S<sup>o</sup>(A) - b * S<sup>o</sup>(B)
- Gibbs free energy is defined as &#916;G = &#916;H - T * &#916;S
- When &#916;G is negative, the reaction is spontaneous.
- When &#916;G is positive, the reaction is NOT spontaneous.
- If &#916;G is 0, then the reaction will end up with an even mix of reactants and products.
- &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub> of any element in its natural phase is zero.
- Given aA + bB --> cC + dD ... &#916;G = c * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(C) + d * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(D) - a * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(A) - b * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(B)

## Examples

CC10. Determine &#916;S
- given: N<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3H<sub>2</sub> (g) --> 2NH<sub>3</sub> (g)
  - These are all gases, but the number of molecules decreases, so the entropy also decreases. So &#916;S is negative.
- given: CaO (s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g) --> CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s)
  - the carbon dioxide goes from a gas to a solid which means the entropy is decreasing. So &#916;S is negative.
- given: 2Ag<sub>2</sub>S (s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (l) --> 4Ag (s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>S (g) + O<sub>2</sub> (g)
  - The reactants are solids and liquids and the products are gases. So entropy is increasing and &#916;S is positive.
  
CC11. Determine &#916;S for N<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3H<sub>2</sub> (g) --> 2NH<sub>3</sub> (g)
- This formula is A + 3B --> 2C, So &#916;S = 2 * S<sup>o</sup>(C) - 1 * S<sup>o</sup>(A) - 3 * S<sup>o</sup>(B)
- From the "Absolute Entropies" table S<sup>o</sup>(N<sub>2</sub> gas) = 191.6 which is A in our equation
- From the "Absolute Entropies" table S<sup>o</sup>(H<sub>2</sub> gas) = 130.6 which is B in our equation
- From the "Absolute Entropies" table S<sup>o</sup>(NH<sub>3</sub> gas) = 192.7 which is C in our equation
- So, &#916;S = 2 * (192.7) - 1 * (191.6) - 3 * (130.6) = -198.0 J/K

CC12. &#916;H = -131.6 kJ and &#916;S = -112 J/K at 25 <sup>o</sup>C. Is is spontaneous at 25 <sup>o</sup>C? spontaneous for what range?
- K is for Kelvin; let's convert 25 to K; T = 25 + 273.15 = 298 K
- &#916;G = &#916;H - T * &#916;S = -131.6 kJ - (298 K) * (-112 J/K) = -131600 J - (-33400 J) = -98200 J
- It is spontaneous at 25 <sup>o</sup>C. Now we can solve for T where &#916;G < 0.
- (-131600 J) - T * (-112 J/K) < 0
- T < (131600 J) / (112 J/K)
- T < 1180 K

CC13. what is the possible range for &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub> of SO<sub>2</sub> (g) in CS<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3O<sub>2</sub> (g) --> CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g) where we know it is spontaneous at 25 <sup>o</sup>C.
- This problem is asking us to solve for the unknown knowing that &#916;G is negative at this temperature (i.e. spontaneous)
- &#916;G = c * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(C) + d * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(D) - a * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(A) - b * &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(B)
- &#916;G = 1 * (-394.4) + 2 * D - 1 * (66.9) - 3 * (0) = 2D - 461.3
- Now, knowing this must be negative solve for D
- 2D - 461.3 < 0
- D < 230.7
- So &#916;G<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub>(SO<sub>2</sub> gas) < 230.7 kJ / mol
