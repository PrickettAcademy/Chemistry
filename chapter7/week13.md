## Notes

- **Stoichiometry** is the part of chemistry that studies amounts of substances that are involved in reactions. Like reading a balanced equation as a recipe.
- **Avagadro's number** is the number 6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup>. This is the number of atoms/molecules in a single mole of a substance.
- **Mole** is a word chemists use to refer to Avagadro's number. Similar to the word dozen.
- When you see the number below the chemical symbol on the periodic chart, it means 2 things: It is the mass of a single atom in amu (atomic mass units); and it is the number of grams you need to collect to have a mole of those atoms. 
- When determining the mass of a molecule, always use the rules of addition for sig figs. DO NOT use the rules for multiplication, even though you may do some multiplying.
- **Molar mass** - the mass of one molecule. This tells you the number of grams in one mole of the substance.
- **Hygroscopic** - readily absorbing moisture, even from the atmosphere
- **hydrated** - used to describe a substance that is hygroscopic
- **anhydrous** - used to describe a hydrated compound that has had the water removed
- A chemical equation gives the amounts of the reactants and products in moles.
- The conversion relationships you get from chemical equations are exact.

## Examples

CC1. How many grams of Mg do you need to get to have 1 mole of Mg atoms?
- This is exactly what the atomic mass unit of Mg tells you. So, just look it up on the periodic table.
- **24.31 grams**

CC2. How many atoms of S are in 0.500 moles of S? How grams is that?
- Remember that 1 mole is 6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup> atoms. That gives us a ratio between these units.
- 0.500 mol * (6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup> atoms / 1 mol) = 0.500 * 6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup> atoms = **3.01 * 10<sup>23</sup> atoms**
- There are a couple of ways to answer the second question. You could take the answer you just got and multiply by the amu value and then convert that grams. Or you can start back at the beginning and remember that the atomic mass unit is the number of grams in 1 mole. Here I will do the second way. The amu for S is 32.06 which is 32.06 grams per mole.
- 0.500 mol * (32.06 g / 1 mol) = 0.500 * 32.06 g = **16.0 g**

CC3. How many grams of water in 8.10 moles? How many molecules is that?
- First we need to know the molar mass of water (H<sup>2</sup>O). Molar mass = 1.01 amu + 1.01 amu + 16.00 amu = 18.02 amu.
- The molar mass is also the number of grams in 1 mole so. X = 8.10 mol * (18.02 g / 1 mol) = **146 g**
- The second question is pretty straight forward since 1 mole = 6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup> molecules.
- So, 8.10 mol * (6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup> molecules / 1 mol) = **4.88 * 10<sup>24</sup> molecules**

CC4. how many moles in 309 g of NH<sup>3</sup>?
- First we need to know the molar mass of NH<sup>3</sup>. Molar mass = 14.01 amu + 1.01 amu + 1.01 amu + 1.01 amu = 17.04 amu.
- Now, we know how many grams of NH<sup>3</sup> in a single mole. 1 mole of NH<sup>3</sup> = 17.04 grams. 
- Finally, we can convert. 309 g * (1 mol / 17.04 g) = 309/17.04 mol = **18.1 mol**

CC5. how many water molecules can be absorbed by each Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup> if 14.2 g of anhydrous Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup> can absorb 24.0 g of water.
- First, we need to know the molar mass of both molecules. 
- Water is 16.0 + 1.01 + 1.01 = 18.02 amu. That's 18.02 grams per mole.
- Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup> is 22.99 + 22.99 + 12.01 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 16.00 = 106.0 amu. That's 106.0 grams per mole.
- Now, we convert the grams to moles (since moles give us the number of molecules)
- Moles of water: 24.0 g * (1 mol / 18.02 g) = 1.33 mol
- Moles of Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup>: 14.2 g * (1 mol / 106.0 g) = 0.134 mol
- Now we can look at the ratios of the moles. This is the same as the ration of the molecules. 
- There's 1.33 mol of water being absorbed by 0.134 mol of Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup>. 1.33 / 0.134 = 9.93 moles of water for every 1 mole of Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup>. In reality we can't have 9.93 of a molecule, so we need to round that up to 10. 
- So, every molecule of Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup> is absorbing 10 molecules of water.
- We can write this as Na<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3</sup> * 10H<sup>2</sup>O

CC6. how many moles of Al and Br<sup>2</sup> would you need to make 0.407 moles of AlBr<sup>3</sup> given 2Al + 3Br<sup>2</sup> -> 2AlBr<sup>3</sup>?
- This is all about the ratios of the molecules/atoms in the equation. So, first let's right those down.
- In this equation: 2Al = 2AlBr<sup>3</sup> (this is in moles)
- In this equation: 3Br<sup>2</sup> = 2AlBr<sup>3</sup> (this is in moles)
- moles of Al = 0.407 mol of AlBr<sup>3</sup> * (2 mol of Al / 2 mol AlBr<sup>3</sup>). Here the "mol of AlBr<sup>3</sup>" cancels out like any other unit. So, we get: 0.407 * (2/2) mol of Al = **0.407 mol of Al**
- moles of Br<sup>2</sup> = 0.407 mol of AlBr<sup>3</sup> * (3 mol of Br<sup>2</sup> / 2 mol AlBr<sup>3</sup>). Again the units cancel and we have: 0.407 * (3/2) mol of Br<sup>2</sup> = **0.611 mol of Br<sup>2</sup>**
