## Notes

- Knowing which substance in a chemical equation is the limiting reactant helps us figure out how much of the other reactants will be used and how much product will be created.
- Stoichiometry also allows us to take the amount of product we want and figure out how much of each reactant we need.
- Usually, you are given amounts in grams. You then have to convert to moles to use the chemical equation. Finally, you may have to convert back to grams to give the answer.

## Examples

CC8. Given 115.9 moles of NH<sup>3</sup> and 4NH<sup>3</sup> + 5O<sup>2</sup> --> 4NO + 6H<sup>2</sup>O, how many moles of water are produced?
- The relationship given by the equation says that 4NH<sup>3</sup> = 6H<sup>2</sup>O. So, we can convert from one to other with the conversion ratio of 4 moles of NH<sup>3</sup> / 6 moles of H<sup>2</sup>O
- So, let's convert: 115.9 moles of NH<sup>3</sup> * (6 moles of H<sup>2</sup>O / 4 moles of NH<sup>3</sup>)
- The units cancel leaving: 115.9 * (6/4 moles of H<sup>2</sup>O) = **173.9 moles of H<sup>2</sup>O**

CC9. If want to produce 67.1 moles of C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>12</sup>O<sup>6</sup>, how much CO<sup>2</sup> do you need, given 6CO<sup>2</sup> + 6H<sup>2</sup>O --> C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>12</sup>O<sup>6</sup> + 6O<sup>2</sup>?
- From the equation we see the relationship we need is 6 moles of CO<sup>2</sup> = 1 moles of C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>12</sup>O<sup>6</sup>
- So, to convert: 67.1 moles of C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>12</sup>O<sup>6</sup> * (6 moles of CO<sup>2</sup> / 1 moles of C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>12</sup>O<sup>6</sup>)
- The units cancel leaving: 67.1 * (6/1 6 moles of CO<sup>2</sup>) = **403 moles of CO<sup>2</sup>**

CC10. 15.0 moles of HCl, 4Hcl + O<sup>2</sup> --> 2Cl<sup>2</sup> + 2H<sup>2</sup>O, how many grams of Chlorine are produced?
- We get moles to start but the answer is asked for in grams!
- ratio: 4 moles of HCl = 2 moles of Cl<sup>2</sup>
- 15.0 moles of HCl * (2 moles of Cl<sup>2</sup> / 4 moles of HCl) = 15.0 * 2/4 moles of Cl<sup>2</sup> = 7.50 moles of Cl<sup>2</sup>
- The molar mass of Cl<sup>2</sup> is 35.45 + 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol
- 7.50 mol * (70.90 g/mol) = 7.50 * 70.90 g = **532g**

CC11. How many moles of NO are needed to produce 855g of N<sup>2</sup>, given 2NO + 2H<sup>2</sup> --> N<sup>2</sup> + 2H<sup>2</sup>O?
- First convert to moles.
- Molar mass of N<sup>2</sup> = 14.01 + 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol
- 855g * (1 mol / 28.02 g) = 30.5 mol of N<sup>2</sup>
- ratio: 2 moles of NO = 1 moles of N<sup>2</sup>
- convert: 30.5 moles of N<sup>2</sup> * (2 moles of NO / 1 moles of N<sup>2</sup>) = 30.5 * 2 moles of NO = **61.0 moles of NO**

CC12. Given 3CaCl<sup>2</sup> + Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup> --> 3CaO + 2AlCl<sup>3</sup>, if you have 100.0 g of CaCl<sup>2</sup>, how many grams of Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup> are needed?
- convert to moles and then back to grams
- molar mass of CaCl<sup>2</sup> = 40.08 + 35.45 + 35.45 = 111.0 g/mol
- convert to moles: 100.0 g * (1 mol / 111.0 g) = 0.9009 mol
- ratio: 3 moles of CaCl<sup>2</sup> = 1 moles of Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup>
- convert: 0.9009 moles of CaCl<sup>2</sup> * (1 moles of Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup> / 3 moles of CaCl<sup>2</sup>) = 0.9009 * 1/3 moles of Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup> = 0.3003 moles of Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup>
- covert back to grams.
- molar mass of Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup> = 26.98 + 26.98 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 16.00 = 102.0 g/mol
- 0.3003 mol * 102.0 g/mol = **30.63g of Al<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup>**
