## Notes

- **Experimental error** - The difference between a quantity's measured value and its true value.
- Repeatability - The ability to repeat an experiment over and over again possibly by different people to reduce the impact of experimental error.
- **percent yield** - percent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100%
- carbohydrate - this referes to the set of molecules that contain some ration of 1 carbon atom, 2 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom.
- **Empirical formula** - A formula that shows the simplest ratio of elements present in a compound.
- **Molecular formula** - A formula that shows the actual number of each element in a compund.

## Examples

CC3. How much ammonia was actually made if the percent yield was 85.1% starting with 500.0 g of N<sup>2</sup> and excess H<sup>2</sup> using N<sup>2</sup> + 3H<sup>2</sup> --> 2NH<sup>3</sup> ?
- First, let's find out what the theoretica yield of ammonia is - to get that we need to know the molar masses of N<sup>2</sup> and NH<sup>3</sup>
- Molar mass of N<sup>2</sup> = 14.01 + 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol
- Molar mass of NH<sup>3</sup> = 14.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 = 17.04 g/mol
- The mole ratio of these is 1 mole of N<sup>2</sup> to 2 moles of NH<sup>3</sup>
- Now we can convert the 500.0 g of N<sup>2</sup> into moles and figure out how many moles of NH<sup>3</sup> should have been produced
- 500.0 g * (1 mol/28.02 g) = 17.84 mol of N<sup>2</sup>
- 17.84 mol N<sup>2</sup> * (2 mol NH<sup>3</sup>/1 mol N<sup>2</sup>) = 35.68 moles of NH<sup>3</sup>
- Almost there, let's get the number of grams of NH<sup>3</sup> that should have been produced
- 35.68 mol NH<sup>3</sup> * (17.04 g/1 mol) = 608.0 g of NH<sup>3</sup>
- Finally, we use the percent yield to determine how many grams of ammonia was actually produced. Remember the formula %yield = actual/theoretical (remember that % means * 100)
- 85.1% = actual/608.0 g --> actual = 0.851 * 608.0 g --> **actual = 517 g**

CC5. empirical formula is CH. If its molar mass is 78.12 g, what is its molecular formula?
- First, we need to know the molar mass of CH which is 12.01 + 1.01 = 13.02 g/mol
- Now let's divide the 2 molar masses to figure out the multiplier in the molecular formula. This is always molecular formular / empirical formula because we want a whole number not a fraction (big number on top).
- multiplier = 78.12/13.02 = 6
- Now, we just multiply each element in the empircal formula by the multiplier
- molecular formula = **C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>6</sup>**

CC6. What is the molecular formula for aluminum oxide?
- Remember first to look at the naming convention used. The second word DOES NOT HAVE a prefix. That means this is an ionic compound.
- _According to Wiles, "ionic compounds DO NOT HAVE a molecular formula"_
- However, you should be able to figure out the **chemical formula** - here is a reminder on how to do that...
- Now remember how to figure out ionic compounds. Use the column in the periodic table to convert each part into an ion then figure out how the ions fit together.
- Al is in column 3A which means it can lose 3 electrons and become Al<sup>3+</sup>
- O is in column 6A which means it can gain 2 electrons and become O<sup>2-</sup>
- If you swap the numbers, we need 2 Al and 3 O which gives us **Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>**

CC7. 50.0 g of Ti is burned in excess oxygen and produces 83.3g of a single product. What is the empirical formula of the product.
- We know that when something burns it combines with oxygen so the product is a combination of Ti and O. 
- We also know that we have 50.0 g of Ti and so the rest must be from O. So there is 33.3 g of oxygen.
- To figure out the emiprical formular we need to know the number of moles not grams. So use the periodic table to convert grams to moles.
- Moles of Ti = 50.0 g * (1 mol/47.87 g) = 1.04 mol of Ti
- Moles of O = 33.3 g * (1 mol/16.00 g) = 2.08 mol of O
- To get a whole number ratio of O and Ti we put the big number on top and divide
- ratio = 2.08 mol O /1.04 mol Ti = 2 mol O for every 1 mol of Ti. So the ratio is 2 to 1
- NOTE: we can't know the molecular formula since we only know the ratio of the elements.
- **empirical formula = TiO<sub>2</sub>**
