## Notes

- **Experimental error** - The difference between a quantity's measured value and its true value.
- Repeatability - The ability to repeat an experiment over and over again possibly by different people to reduce the impact of experimental error.
- **percent yield** - percent yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100%
- 

## Examples

CC3. How much ammonia was actually made if the percent yield was 85.1% starting with 500.0 g of N<sup>2</sup> and excess H<sup>2</sup> using N<sup>2</sup> + 3H<sup>2</sup> --> 2NH<sup>3</sup> ?
- First, let's find out what the theoretica yield of ammonia is - to get that we need to know the molar masses of N<sup>2</sup> and NH<sup>3</sup>
- Molar mass of N<sup>2</sup> = 14.01 + 14.01 = 28.02 g/mol
- Molar mass of NH<sup>3</sup> = 14.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 = 17.04 g/mol
- The mole ratio of these is 1 mole of N<sup>2</sup> to 2 moles of NH<sup>3</sup>
- Now we can convert the 500.0 g of N<sup>2</sup> into moles and figure out how many moles of NH<sup>3</sup> should have been produced
- 500.0 g * (1 mol/28.02 g) = 17.84 mol of N<sup>2</sup>
- 17.84 mol N<sup>2</sup> * (2 mol NH<sup>3</sup>/1 mol N<sup>2</sup>) = 35.68 moles of NH<sup>3</sup>
- Almost there, let's get the number of grams of NH<sup>3</sup> that should have been produced
- 35.68 mol NH<sup>3</sup> * (17.04 g/1 mol) = 608.0 g of NH<sup>3</sup>
- Finally, we use the percent yield to determine how many grams of ammonia was actually produced. Remember the formula %yield = actual/theoretical (remember that % means * 100)
- 85.1% = actual/608.0 g --> actual = 0.851 * 608.0 g --> **actual = 517 g**
