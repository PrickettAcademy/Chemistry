## Notes

- **Percent composition** - if you know the percentage of the masses of each element in a molecule you can figure out the empirical formular. 
- You can figure out the amount of oxygen that might have been in a molecule at the start of combustion by figuring out the amount of carbon and hydrogen first. 
- **Polyatomic ions** - An ion composed of 2 or more atoms that are covalently bonded to one another.
- We need to memorize the following polyatomic ions and their charges and names
  - Ammonium - NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>
  - Hydronium - H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>
  - Carbonate - CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>
  - Hydroxide - OH<sup>-</sup>
  - Nitrate - NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
  - Sulfate - SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
  - Phosphate - PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>

## Examples

CC10. What is the percent composition for each element in the compound H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>?
- Remember that the percent composition is based on mass, so we need to convert the mole ratios in the formula to mass ratios
- So, what's the molar mass of the molecule? 1.01 + 1.01 + 1.01 + 30.97 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 98.00 g/mol
- What's the percent of that molar mass that is hydrogen? (3.03/98.00) * 100 = **3.09% Hydrogen**
- What about P? (30.97/98.00) * 100 = **31.60% Phosphorous**
- What about O? (64.00/98.00) * 100 = **65.31% Oxygen**

CC11. 62.2% Fe, 35.6% O, 2.2% H; what is the empirical formula?
- We don't know the molar mass of the compound, so where do we start? You can assume the molar mass is 100g as in the book or...
- molar masses of elementes Fe 55.85 g/mol; O 16.00 g/mol; H 1.01 g/mol
- Let's assume there is only one Fe atom in the molecule. If so, the molar mass of the compound is... (55.85/X) * 100 = 62.2%
- If you solve for X, you find that the molar mass is 89.8 g/mol
- Then, the mass of Oxygen atoms is (Y/89.9) * 100 = 35.6%. Solve for Y and get 32.0 g/mol which means there are 2 atoms of O
- Finally, the mass of H atoms is (Z/89.8) * 100 = 2.2%. Solve for Z and get 1.98 g/mol which is just shy of 2.02 which would be 2 atoms of H
- **So the empirical formula is FeO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>**

CC12. What's the name of K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>?
- The last part is Sulfate that has a charge of -2.
- This is an ionic compound so the naming is simple...
- **Potassium Sulfate**

CC13. What is the chemical formula of aluminum carbonate? How many O's?
- Carbonate is CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>
- Al is in column 3A which means it can give up 3 electrons to get a +3 charge
- switch the numbers and combine
- **chemical formula is Al<sup>2</sup>(CO<sup>3</sup>)<sup>3</sup>**
- **empirical formula is the same since this is an ionic compound. So there are 9 O's**

CC14. What is the name of FePO<sup>4</sup>? (needs a roman numeral)
- PO<sup>4</sup> is Phosphate and has charge of -3
- That means Fe will have to have a +3 charge so the roman number is III
- **Iron (III) Phosphate**
