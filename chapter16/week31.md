## Notes

- reactions don't just go in one direction. There are forward reactions and reverse reactions.
- when the concentration of products and reactants stops changing, the reaction is at equalibrium
- chemical equalibrium - the state that occurs in a chemical reaction when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.
- equalibrium constant is defined as the ration of products to reactants when a reaction is at equalibrium - K = ([C]<sup>c</sup><sub>eq</sub>[D]<sup>d</sup><sub>eq</sub>)/([A]<sup>a</sup><sub>eq</sub>[B]<sup>b</sup><sub>eq</sub>)
- the equalibrium constant is different for every temperature at which you run the reaction
- K > 1 means that the reaction will run forward
- K = 1 means that the reaction is balanced between products and reactants
- K < 1 means that the reaction will run in reverse
- don't include "concentrations" of solids or liquids in the equilibrium constant equation.
