## Notes

- reactions don't just go in one direction. There are forward reactions and reverse reactions.
- when the concentration of products and reactants stops changing, the reaction is at equalibrium
- chemical equalibrium - the state that occurs in a chemical reaction when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.
- equalibrium constant is defined as the ration of products to reactants when a reaction is at equalibrium - K = ([C]<sup>c</sup><sub>eq</sub>[D]<sup>d</sup><sub>eq</sub>)/([A]<sup>a</sup><sub>eq</sub>[B]<sup>b</sup><sub>eq</sub>)
- the equalibrium constant is different for every temperature at which you run the reaction
- K > 1 means that the reaction will run forward
- K = 1 means that the reaction is balanced between products and reactants
- K < 1 means that the reaction will run in reverse
- don't include "concentrations" of solids or liquids in the equilibrium constant equation.

## Examples

CC1. When did the reactants and products stop changing? (see book for table)
- The forward rate and reverse rates become equal and stop changing at 65 seconds

CC2. what is the equilibrium constant? reaction: 2I<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>S (g) <--> S<sub>2</sub> (g) + 4HI (g); concentrations at eq - 0.045 M, 0.045 M, 0.055 M, and 0.065 M respectively.
- formula - K = ([C]<sup>c</sup><sub>eq</sub>[D]<sup>d</sup><sub>eq</sub>)/([A]<sup>a</sup><sub>eq</sub>[B]<sup>b</sup><sub>eq</sub>)
- K = ((0.055 M)<sup>1</sup> * (0.065 M)<sup>4</sup>) / ((0.045 M)<sup>2</sup> * (0.045 M)<sup>2</sup>)
- K = 0.24 M

CC3. Use the value of K to determine reaction type.
- a. K is greater than 10<sup>6</sup>, so this reaction is essentially all forward
- b. K is greater than 1, so the reaction is both forward and reverse, but it is weighted towards forward
- c. K is less than 1, so the reaction is both forward and reverse, but it is weighted towards reverse
- d. K is less than 10<sup>-6</sup>, so this reaction is essentially all reverse

CC4. Write the equilibrium equation for 4Cu<sup>+</sup> (aq) + S (s) + 3H<sub>2</sub>O (l) <--> 4Cu (s) + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (aq) + 4H<sup>+</sup> (aq)
- K = ([C]<sup>c</sup><sub>eq</sub>[D]<sup>d</sup><sub>eq</sub>)/([A]<sup>a</sup><sub>eq</sub>[B]<sup>b</sup><sub>eq</sub>)
- don't include solids or liquids
- K = ([H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>]<sub>eq</sub>[H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>4</sup><sub>eq</sub>)/([Cu<sup>+</sup>]<sup>4</sup><sub>eq</sub>)

CC5. H<sub>2</sub> (g) + I<sub>2</sub> (g) <--> 2HI (g) has an equilibrium constant of 144. If the concentrations are 0.0460 M, 0.0440 M, 0.540 M, is it at equilibrium or which way is it moving?
- K = ([C]<sup>c</sup><sub>eq</sub>[D]<sup>d</sup><sub>eq</sub>)/([A]<sup>a</sup><sub>eq</sub>[B]<sup>b</sup><sub>eq</sub>)
- K = (0.540 M)<sup>2</sup> / (0.0460 M * 0.0440 M) = 144
- The reaction is equilibrium

CC5. H<sub>2</sub>O (g) + C (s) <--> H<sub>2</sub> (g) + CO (g) has an equilibrium constant of 0.242 M at 900 K. If the concentrations are 0.045 M, 0.125 M, 0.125 M, is it at equilibrium or which way is it moving?
- K = (0.125 M * 0.125 M) / (0.045 M) = 0.347 M
- The reaction is not in equilibrium and needs to continue to move in reverse since it will be moving down from 0.347 M to 0.242 M
