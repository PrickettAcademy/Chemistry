## Notes

- Salt melts ice because it disturbs the equilibrium of the ice and the water shifting it towards melting.
- Le Chatelier's Principle - When an equilibrium is stressed, it will shift in a way that relieves the stress and reestablishes equilibrium.
- When concentrations are increased, an equilibrium will shift away from the side that experiences an increase in concentration
- When concentrations are decreased, an equilibrium will shift towards the side that experiences a decrease in concentration
- When temperature is raised, an equilibrium will shift away from the side that contains energy.
- When temperature is lowered, an equilibrium will shift towards the side that contains energy.
- When pressure is increased, an equilibrium will shift away from the side that has more gas molecules.
- When pressure is decreased, an equilibrium will shift towards the side that has more gas molecules.
- If there are no gas molecules, the equilibrium doesn't shift when pressure changes.
- Acid ionization constant - the equilibrium constant for the raction between an acid and water
- when the acid ionization constant is so large that there is no reverse reaction, we call that acid a **Strong Acid**
- when the acid ionization constant is less than 1, we call that acid a **Weak Acid**
- Base ionization constant - the equilibrium constant for the reaction between a base and water
- when the base ionization constant is so large that there is no reverse reaction, we call that base a **Strong Base**
- when the base ionization constant is less than 1, we call that base a **Weak Base**
- remember to see scientific discoveries as "So, that's how God did it." - Dr. Henry F. Schaefer

## Examples

CC7. What happens when I add/remove reactants/products
- a. If I add more product, it shifts the reaction towards the reactants (the reverse reaction) until it reaches equilibrium again. This will cause the concentration of all of the reactants to go up.
- b. If I remove products, it shifts the reaction towards the products (the forward reaction) until it reaches equilibrium again. This will decrease the concentration of all of the reactants.
- c. If I add more liquid water, nothing will happen since we ignore liquids and solids in the equilibrium constant equation.

CC8. If a solid is added that uses up the product and we started with 2 moles of iodine and 1 mole of hydrogen, how much iodine and hydrogen will be left after a long period of time?
- The formula tells us the the ration of iodine to hydrogen is one to one in the reaction, but we have 2 moles of iodine. So, the limiting reactant is hydrogen.
- Since the products are being used up by the solid, the reaction will not reach equibrium and run to completion.
- At the end, there will still be 1 mole of iodine and no hydrogen left.

CC9. The equilibrium has a &#916;H of 131.3 kJ. what happens to the concentration of each gas in the reaction when the temperature is decreased?
- First, you have to remember that "For exothermic reactions, &#916;H is negative. For endothermic reactions, &#916;H is positive."
- So the reaction is endothermic: C (s) + H<sub>2</sub>O (g) + 131.3 kJ <--> CO (g) + H<sub>2</sub> (g)
- If we lower the temperature, it will shift towards the reactants because that is the side with the energy.
- That means that the water vapor will increase while the carbon monoxide and hydrogen decrease.

CC10. What will happen when the pressure is increased?
- First count the number of GAS molecules on each side of the reaction
- There are 2 molecules of SO<sub>3</sub> on the reactants side and 3 total molecules on the products side
- Increasing the pressure will shift the reaction away from the side with more molecules, so it will shift the reaction towards the reactants
- So, the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> (a product) will go down.

CC11. give the base ionization constant for C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N which is a weak base.
- a. K<sub>b</sub> = ([C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>]<sub>eq</sub> * [OH<sup>-</sup>]<sub>eq</sub>) / ([C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N]<sub>eq</sub>)
- b. If you read carefully, you would know that the beaker pH 11 contains ammonia, and he says that pH is this base. Since pH 11 is more basic than pH 9, ammonia should be a stronger base than this base. So, the constant should be smaller than ammonia's constant. So, 1.4 x 10<sup>-9</sup> M is the answer.
