## Notes
- **Pure substance** - A substance whose properties are the same throughout
- **Mixture** - A combination of two or more pure substances
- **Homogeneous mixture** - A mixture whose composition is the same throughout the sample
- **Heterogeneous mixture** - A mixture whose composition is different in different parts of the sample
- Milk and air are examples of homogenous mixtures
- Italian dressing is an example of heterogenous mixtures
- **Law of Mass Conservation** - In any chemical or physical process, the total mass of everything involved must remain the same.
- **Element** - A substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances
- **Compound** - A pure substance that is composed of two or more elements
- Zinc sulfide is an example of a compound than can be broken down into zinc and sulfur (both elements)
- The difference between a compound and a mixture is that a compound has it's own properties while a mixture has the same properties as the substances in it
- **Law of Definite Proportions** - A given compound will always have the same proportions of elements by mass
