## Notes
- **Pure substance** - A substance whose properties are the same throughout
- **Mixture** - A combination of two or more pure substances
- **Homogeneous mixture** - A mixture whose composition is the same throughout the sample
- **Heterogeneous mixture** - A mixture whose composition is different in different parts of the sample
- Milk and air are examples of homogenous mixtures
- Italian dressing is an example of heterogenous mixtures
- **Law of Mass Conservation** - [video](https://youtu.be/dExpJAECSL8) - In any chemical or physical process, the total mass of everything involved must remain the same.
- **Element** - A substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances
- **Compound** - A pure substance that is composed of two or more elements
- Zinc sulfide is an example of a compound than can be broken down into zinc and sulfur (both elements)
- The difference between a compound and a mixture is that a compound has it's own properties while a mixture has the same properties as the substances in it
- **Law of Definite Proportions** - A given compound will always have the same proportions of elements by mass

## Examples
**Conservation of Mass** - You burn a piece of wood whose mass is 134g in a closed container with 101g of oxygen. When the fire is out you measure 97.0g of soot left over along with various gasses. What is the total mass of the various gases?
- First, we know that no mass can be added or removed since it is in a closed container.
- We also know that the initial mass is the mass of the wood plus the mass of the oxygen. 134g + 101g = 235g (keep the same precision)
- The final mass must be the mass of the soot plus the mass of the gasses. This value must be equal to 235g, our initial mass.
- So, the mass of the gasses is the final mass minus the mass of the soot. 235g - 97.0g = **138g** (keep the same precision)

**Law of Definite Proportions** - You take 56.5g of Calcium and 100.0g of Chlorine and combine them to get 156.5g of Calcium Chloride with nothing left over. How much Calcium and Chlorine do you need to combine to get 200.0g of Calcium Chloride?
- First, we need to understand the ratio of each input. 
- To get 156.5g of Calcium Chloride, we started with 56.5g of Calcium. The ratio is 56.5g/156.5g = 0.361 or 36.1% (units cancel out)
- To get 156.5g of Calcium Chloride, we started with 100.0g of Chlorine. The ratio is 100.0g/156.5g = 0.6390 or 63.90% (units cancel out)
- These ratios tell me that 36.1% of the Calcium Chloride is Calcium and 63.90% is Chlorine. 
- So, if I want 200g of Calcium Chloride, I need to start with those percentages of 200.
- I need 36.1% of 200g to be Calcium and 63.90% of 200g to be Chlorine. 200.0g * 0.361 = 72.2g of Calcium. 200.0g * 0.6390 = 127.8g of Chlorine.
