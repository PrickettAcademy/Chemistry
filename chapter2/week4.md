## Notes

**Dalton's Atomic Theory**
- All matter is made up of atons, which are indestructable and indivisable
- All atons of a given element are identical in all their properties
- Compounds are formed by a combination of two or more different kinds of atoms
- A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of the atoms that exist in the substances which are reacting.

**Molecule** - A combination of two or more atons joined together<br>
**The Law of Multiple Proportions** - [video](https://youtu.be/l-IPd_r7ytw) - When 2 elements combine to form different compounds, a fixed amount of one element will combine with the other element so that the ratio of the masses of the other element is a small whole number.

**CC 9** - 6.4g Cu + 1.6g O -> ???g CuO (cupric oxide); 2Cu + O -> Cu<sub>2</sub>O (**cuprous** oxide); How much copper do I need to make cuprous oxide if I start with 1.6g of Oxygen?
- First, you need to realize that 1.6g is the same amount of oxygen as in the first example that made cupric oxide.
- Next, you need to notice that cuprous oxide needs 2 times as many atoms of copper as cupric oxide.
- So, if we have the same amount of oxygen (1.6g) then we need twice as much copper (2 * 6.4g) = 12.8g 

**Protons** - [video of Rutherford's experiement](https://youtu.be/5pZj0u_XMbc) - positively charged particles in the nucleus of an atom<br>
**Neutrons** - non-charged particles in the nucleus of an atom<br>
**Electrons** negatively charged particles outside the nucleus of an atom<br>
**Plum pudding model** - Atoms are like positively charged pudding with negatively charged bits throughout the pudding.<br>
**Plantary model** - Atons have positively charged particles in the center with negatively charged particles orbiting the center.<br>
**Nuclear fission** - [video](https://youtu.be/Ezbyg2iNdQs) - The breaking apart of one atom to form smaller differnt atoms<br>
**Isotopes** - [video](https://youtu.be/EboWeWmh5Pg) - Two or more atoms of the same element that have a different number of neutrons<br>
**Element** - A collection of atoms that all have the same number of protons.

**Dalton's Atomic Theory (corrected)**
- All matter is made up of atons, ~~which are indestructable and indivisable~~
- All atons of a given element are identical in ~~all~~ their *chemical* properties
- Compounds are formed by a combination of two or more different kinds of atoms
- A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of the atoms that exist in the substances which are reacting.
