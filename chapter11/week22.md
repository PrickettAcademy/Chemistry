## Notes

- Neutralize - When you add just the right amount of an acid to just the right amount of a base, the resulting solution is neither acidic or basic (i.e. the pH of the solution is 7).
- REMEMBER Molarity: M = moles of solute / Liters of solution. You will need this in this chapter
- acid/base titration - the process by which an acid of known concentration is added to a base of unknown concentration (or vice-versa) until a neutral pH is reached so as to determine the unknown concentration.
- dilute - the addition of water to a concentrated solution in order to weaken the solution. The number of moles of acid or base remains the same while the volume of the solution is increased.

## Examples

CC9. how many mL of a 3.41 M solution of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is needed to neutralize 750.0 mL of a 5.00 M solution of KOH?
- First, you need to notice that M is for molarity. M = moles of solute / L of solution. We can use this to get the number of moles of each solution.
- Next we need to know the chemical equation for this acid/base reaction. KOH is the base and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is the acid. They should combine to form water and a salt.
- the SO<sub>4</sub> ino has a -2 charge (from the polyatomic ion table). The K ion has a +1 charge (from the Periodic table).
- Unbalanced: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + KOH --> H<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
- Balanced: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2KOH --> 2H<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
- So, we have 0.7500 L of KOH solution * 5.00 mol KOH / L of KOH solution = 3.75 moles of KOH
- That means we need 3.75 mol KOH * (1 mol H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> / 2 mol KOH) = 1.88 moles of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
- But how many liters of solution is that? 3.41 mol/L = 1.88 mol / X
- X = 1.88 mol / (3.41 mol / L) = 0.551 L = **551 mL of the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution**

CC10. what is the concentration of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, if 115.0 mL of it are titrated against 97.1 mL of a 1.12 M solutoin of LiOH?
- remember molarity:  M = moles of solute / L of solution
- PO<sub>4</sub> ions have a -3 charge. Li ions have a +1 charge.
- unbalanced equation: H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + LiOH --> H<sub>2</sub>O + Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
- balanced: H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + 3LiOH --> 3H<sub>2</sub>O + Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
- moles of LiOH = 0.0971 L * 1.12 mol/L = 0.109 mol
- moles of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 0.109 mol LiOH * (1 mol H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> / 3 mol LiOH) = 0.0363 mol
- Finally, what is the concencration of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>?
- M = 0.0363 mol / 0.1150 L = **0.316 M**

CC11. how much water should be added to a 9.12 M solution of MgCl<sub>2</sub> to get 500.0 mL of a 4.50 M solution of MgCl<sub>2</sub>?
- The key here is to understand the molarity equation: M = moles of MgCl<sub>2</sub> / L of solution
- Let's figure out how many moles of MgCl<sub>2</sub> should be in the final result.
- 4.50 mol/L = X / 0.5000 L. X = 4.50 mol * 0.5000 = 2.25 mol
- Now we need to know how much of the 9.12 M solution to use to get that many moles
- 9.12 mol/L = 2.25 mol / V. V = 2.25 mol / 9.12 mol/L  = 0.247 L
- notice that 500 mL - 247 mL = 253 mL
- **So, we take 247 mL of the 9.12 M solution and add enough water until we get 500.0 mL of 4.50 M solution**
