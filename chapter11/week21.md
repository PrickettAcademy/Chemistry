## Notes

- Acidic characteristics: tends to taste sour, are covalent electrolytes, turn blue litmus paper red
- Indicators - a chemical that undergoes a distinct observable change (usually a color change) when the conditions in its solution change.
- litmus is an example of an acid/base indicator.
- Characteristics of bases: tend to taste bitter, tend to feel slippery when mixed with water, turn red litmus paper blue
- Definition of an acid - A chemical that donates an H<sup>+</sup>
- Definition of a base - A chemical that accepts an H<sup>+</sup>
- amphoteric - capable of reacting as either an acid or a base. Water is amphoteric
- spectator ions are ions that don't actually participate in the reaction.
- Ionic compounds that contain the hydroxide ion can act as bases.
- Ammonia is a covalent base.
- If a covalent compound starts with an H, it can usually act like an acid.
- Polyprotic acid - an acid that can donate two or more H<sup>+</sup> ions.
- An acid reacts with an ionic base to make water and a salt.
- pH scale (potential hydrogen scale) - measures the level of an acid or base. The scale is from 0 to 14. Everything that measures 0-6.9 is an acid and everything from 7.1 to 14 is a base. Things that are 7.0 are neutral - not an acid or a base. The closer an acid is to 0, the stronger and more caustic that acid is. The closer a base is to 14 the stronger and more caustic that base is.

## Examples

CC1. Washing soda is most likely a base since most cleaning products are bases.

CC2. Since acids tend to be sour. Sour milk is more acidic than fresh milk.

CC3. Which is the acid and which is the base?
- Acids lose an H and Bases gain an H
- So, CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> must be the acid and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N is the base

CC4. Which is the acid and which is the base?
- H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> loses its H<sub>2</sub> so it is the acid
- KOH gains an H to make water, so it is the base

CC5. Acid or base?
- CsOH - base because the OH ion will attract an H
- HI - acid because the H will be lost
- H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> - acid because it will lose its H<sub>2</sub>
- NaBr - neither
- Sr(OH)<sub>2</sub> - base because its OH ions will attract H ions
- HC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - acid because it will lose an H

CC6. chemical equation for HClO<sub>3</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>?
- HClO<sub>3</sub> is an ionic acid and will give up its H ion
- NH<sub>3</sub> is a covalent base and will happily gain an H ion
- HClO<sub>3</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub> --> ClO<sub>3</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>

CC7. chemical equation for H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>?
- Both the acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and the base (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) are ionic which means they will form water and a salt.
- OH has a -1 charge so here the Al has a +3 charge
- H has a +1 charge and we have 2 of them on the CO<sub>3</sub> which means CO<sub>3</sub> has a -2 charge.
- So the salt should be Al<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
- 3H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 2Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> --> 6H<sub>2</sub>O + Al<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>

CC8. pH's of 1, 3, 7, 9, 14
a. most acidic? 1
b. neutral? 7
c. most basic? 14
d. baking soda solution? 9 - baking sode is a base but not a dangerous one
e. turns anthocyanins pink? 3 - because 2-3 is the range that turns those pink
f. which could be distilled water? 7
