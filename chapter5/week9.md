## Notes

- [Online tool to get lewis structures](https://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/view.jsp?id=c11e9ad0ab00998884f0733c8f62c07d)
- **Covalent bond** - A chemical bond that is made by sharing electrons.
- In Lewis dot diagrams, covalent bonds are written as lines.
- **Homonuclear diatomic** - a molecule consisting of two atoms of the same element. Ex. Cl<sub>2</sub>
- Remember the following Homonuclear diatomic molecules: **H, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I**
- Hydrogen's ideal electron configuration consists of 2 valence electrons (not 8)
- Reminder: compounds consist of more than one element (Br<sub>2</sub> is not a compound)
- **Covalent compound** - A compound whose elements are held together with covalent bonds. These DO NOT contain metals.

## Examples

CC1. Lewis structure for Bromine (as it exists in nature)
- First, I need to remember that Bromine is one of the homonuclear diatomic molecules, which means it combines with itself. So, there are 2 atoms of Bromine in each molecule.
- The symbol for Bromine is **Br**
- If I write the lewis dot structure for Br it has 7 valence electrons, because it is in column 7A. I will draw 2 of them together since there are 2 atoms in the molecule.
- If they each contribute 1 electron to share, they will each have 8 valence electrons some of the time. Since this is a covalent bond (sharing electrons), I will draw a line instead of the shared electrons.

CC2. Lewis structures for HCl, CH<sub>3</sub>Br
1. One atom of each H and Cl, Cl has 7 valence electrons because it is in Column 7A. Thus it has 7 dots. H has 1 dot. This is a covalent bond because there are no metals, so the bond is written with a line. Don't forget to keep the other 6 dots around the Cl that are not being shared.

2. One atom of C, 3 of H, and 1 of Br. C has 4 dots because it is in column 4A, each H has 1 dot. Br has 7 dots because it is in column 7A. We put C in the middle since it has the most missing dots. We can easily pair each side of the C with the 2 H's and the one Br. These are covalent bonds because there are no metals. Thus the bonds are written with lines. Don't forget to keep the other 6 dots around the Br that are not being shared.
