## Notes

- Covalent bond - A chemical bond that is made by sharing electrons.
- In Lewis dot diagrams, covalent bonds are written as lines.
- Homonuclear diatomic - a molecule consisting of two atoms of the same element. Ex. Cl<sub>2</sub>
- Remember the following Homonuclear diatomic molecules: **H, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I**
- 

## Examples

CC1. Lewis structure for Bromine (as it exists in nature)
- First, I need to remember that Bromine is one of the homonuclear diatomic molecules, which means it combines with itself. So, there are 2 atoms of Bromine in each molecule.
- The symbol for Bromine is **Br**
- If I write the lewis dot structure for Br it has 7 valence electrons, because it is in column 7A. I will draw 2 of them together since there are 2 atoms in the molecule.
- If they each contribute 1 electron to share, they will each have 8 valence electrons some of the time. Since this is a covalent bond (sharing electrons), I will draw a line instead of the shared electrons.
