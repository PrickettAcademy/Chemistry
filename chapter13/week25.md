## Notes

- thermochemistry is the study of heat that is absorbed or released by chemical processes.
- Heat - energy that is exchanged because of a difference in temperature or a change in phase.
- heat is energy measured in Joules
- energy is the ability to do work
- work is the application of a force to move an object over a distance.
- heat moves atoms/molecules
- calorie - the amount of heat required to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree celsius.
- Calorie is 1000 calories. This is used to measure the energy of food.
- Specific Heat Capacity (or just specific heat) - the amount of heat it takes to raise a specific mass of a substance 1 <sup>o</sup>C
- Specific heat of water is 4.184 J/(g <sup>o</sup>C)
- We measure heat with the following formula: q = m * c * &#916;T where q is heat measured in Joules; m is the mass; c is the specific heat for that substance; and &#916;T is the change in temperature
- &#916;T = T<sub>final</sub> - T<sub>initial</sub>
- calorimetry - a process of determining specific heat capacities.
- calorimeter - a device used to measure a substances specific heat.
- heat of an object in a calorimeter is defined by this equation -q<sub>object</sub> = q<sub>liquid</sub> + q<sub>calorimeter</sub>
- In a calorimetry experiment, the temperatures of the liquid and the calorimeter are always the same. In addition, the final temperature of the liquid, calorimeter, and object are all the same.

## Examples

CC1. No heat is produced when 2 blocks of equal temperature are brought into contact.

CC2. Doe a mixture of ice and water where the ice is melting have heat in the system?
- The answer is YES. heat is being transfered from the water into the ice causing it to melt. 

CC3. If I used 500 Calories to heat up 10 liters of water at 25 <sup>o</sup>C, what's the final temperature?
- first, convert to calories - 500 Calories = 500,000 calories
- now, convert to mL which is about equal to 1 gram of water. 10 L = 10,000 mL ~ 10,000 g of water
- So, if 1 calorie can increase 1 gram of water by 1 degree....
- then 500,000 calories can raise 10,000 grams of water = 500,000 / 10,000 = 50 degrees
- So the final temperature is 75 <sup>o</sup>C

CC4. which element gets the coolest? which stays the warmest? silver, lead, zinc, copper, aluminum
- First we need to look up their specific heats: silver = 0.240, lead = 0.160, zinc = 0.387, copper = 0.386, aluminum = 0.900
- The one with the lowest number will change the fastest (get the coolest) ==> **lead**
- the one with the highest number will change the slowest (stay the warmest) ==> **aluminum**

CC5. 1.5 kg object cools down from 22.5 <sup>o</sup>C to 8.1 <sup>o</sup>C losing 6.3 kJ - what is the specific heat?
- First remember the formula: q = m * c * &#916;T
- Notice here that we are losing energy so the change in temp and the heat are negative!
- Fill in what we know: -6300 J = 1500 g * c * (-14.4 <sup>o</sup>C)
- Solve for c: c = -6300 J / (1500 g * -14.4 <sup>o</sup>C)
- c = **0.29 J/(g <sup>o</sup>C)**

CC6. What's the mass of nickel if T goes from 23.4 <sup>o</sup>C to 44.3 <sup>o</sup>C when 987 J are added?
- we are given c = 0.440 J/(g <sup>o</sup>C)
- So, 987 J = m * 0.440 J(g <sup>o</sup>C) * 20.9 <sup>o</sup>C
- m = 987 J / (0.440 J(g <sup>o</sup>C) * 20.9 <sup>o</sup>C) = **107.33 g of nickel**

CC7. 20.0 g of unknown metal at 110.0 <sup>o</sup>C is put in a calorimeter that has 115.0 g of water at 24.1 <sup>o</sup>C. The experiment ends when the water is at 26.3 <sup>o</sup>C. Ignoring the effects of the calorimeter what is the specific heat?
- To calculate the specific heat I need 3 things: grams of metal which was given; change in temperature which is easy to calculate; and the energy gained or lost. This last part is the hardest because we have to calculate the energy gained or lost from by the water first.
- The energy gained by the water is given by q = 115.0 g * 4.184 J /(g <sup>o</sup>C) * 2.2 <sup>o</sup>C = 1060 J
- So, the energy for the object is the negative of that since the object lost heat ==> -1060 J
- Now we can calculate the specific heat of the object. (the energy and temp change for the objec are negative since it lost heat)
- -1060 J = 20.0 g * c * (26.3 <sup>o</sup>C - 110.0 <sup>o</sup>C)
- c = -1060 J / (20.0 g * -83.7 <sup>o</sup>C) = **0.633 J/(g <sup>o</sup>C)**
