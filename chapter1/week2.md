## Notes:
- Matter has mass (not necessarily weight). Weight is not the same as mass. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object. Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object.
- Time is measured in seconds. 
- Density is defined as mass divided by volume. This relationship between mass and volume is an important propery of matter. 

## Examples:
**Convert 1200 grams to milligrams**
- First we need to find out the relationship between g and mg. Since this is the metric system you just have to remember that milli means 1000. So, 1g = 1000mg. We want to eliminate grams, so we will use the fraction 1000mg/1g. Note that this conversion is NOT a measurement and so it can have as many significant figures as we need.
- Now multiply: 1200g * 1000mg/1g = 1200000mg
- This can also be written in scientific notation as 1.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> mg

**Calculate the density of an object with a mass of 45 grams and a volume of 15 milliliters**
- First remember the formula: D = M/V (desity is mass over volume)
- Now, plug in what you know (keep the units): D = 45g/15mL
- Now, solve for D: D = 3.0 g/mL (notice that the units for density is a combination of mass units over volume units). You may also notice that I made sure to put 3.0 instead of 3 to show the right number of significant figures.

**Calculate the mass of an object with a known density of 3g/mL and a volume of 3 liters**
- You may have noticed that the volume is in liters instead of milliliters. We need to convert it to mL.
- The conversion relationship is 1L = 1000mL. So, 3L * 1000mL/1L = 3000mL
- Now, remember the formula: D = M/V
- Then, plug in what you know (keep the units): 3g/mL = M/3000mL
- Finally, solve for M (this time it's a bit more complicated). 
  - Start by multiplying both sides by 3000mL (keep the units). 3g/mL * 3000mL = M/3000mL * 3000mL
  - On the left side, the mL cancels out and we multiply 3g * 3000 = 9000g
  - On the right side, the entire 3000mL cancels out and we just have M
  - Now we see that M = 9000g (or 9 * 10<sup>3</sup>)
  
**Calculate the volume of an object with a known density of 5.0g/mL and a mass of 21 kilograms**
- First, let's convert the mass into grams. 1kg = 1000g. So, 21kg * 1000g/1kg = 21000g
- Now, remember the formula: D = M/V
- Plug in the numbers: 5.0g/mL = 21000g/V
- Now solve for V (this is tough because V is on the bottom of a fraction)
  - Start by getting V on the top. To do this we can multiply both sides by V.
  - On the left side, we get V * 5.0g/mL
  - On the right side, the V is canceled out and we are left with 21000g
  - So, we have V * 5.0g/mL = 21000g
  - To get V by itself, we can do 2 things: divide both sides by 5.0g and multiply both sides by mL. This is the same as multiplying both sides by mL/5.0g.
  - On the left side, we have ml/5.0g * V * 5.0g/mL. The mL cancels out and the 5.0g also cancels out. So we are left with just V
  - On the right side, we have 21000g * mL/5.0g. The g cancels out and we can divide 21000 by 5.0 and get 4200. That leaves 4200mL.
  - So, V = 4200mL or 4.2 * 10<sup>3</sup>
