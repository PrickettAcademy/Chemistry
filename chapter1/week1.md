## Notes:
- When doing math with measurements you need to be careful to keep the right number of significant digits.
- When adding numbers, the answer can only be as **precise** as the **least precise** number being added.
- When multiplying numbers, the answer must have the same number of **significant figures** as the number with the **least** number of significant figures.
- There is always some error in the last significant figure in a measurement.
- When you have a relationship between 2 units, you can convert from one unit to another. This is called `Unit Conversion`.
- The metric system has prefixes that tell you how that measurement is related to the base measurement.
- The prefixes are mega, kilo, hecto, deca, centi, milli, micro, and nano.
- Scientific notation allows us to more easily represent measurements. 

## Examples:
Adding 2 measurements: 23 ft + 3.01 ft
- First, we need to identify the least precise number. The first number's smallest significant digit is the 3 which is in the ones place. The second number's smallest significant digit is 1 and is in the hundredth's place. Since, the hundredth's place is to the right of the ones place, hundredths is MORE precise. So, the ones place is LESS precise. That means that 23 ft is LESS precise than 3.01 ft. So, our answer must be no more precise than the one's place. And we must round to the nearest one's place for the answer. 
- Now, we add the numbers as normal: 23 ft + 3.01 ft = 26.01 ft
- Finally, we round to the nearest one's place: 26.01 ft to the nearest one is 26 ft. 

Adding 3 measurements: 25cm + 40cm + 13cm
- The least precise number is 40cm because it only has one significant digit - the 4. The 4 is in the ten's place.
- Add them all together (no rounding yet): 25cm + 40cm + 13cm = 78cm
- Finally, round the answer to the nearest ten: 78cm to the nearest ten is 80cm

Multiplying 2 measurements: 3.5cm * 4cm
- First, we need to count the significant digits in both numbers. The first number has 2 significant digits and the second number has 1 significant digit. That means our answer can only have 1 significant digit. We will have to round the answer to get it down to the right number of significant digits.
- Now, we multiply as normal: 3.5cm * 4cm = 14cm<sup>2</sup>
- Finally, round the answer to the nearest number that will give us just one significant figure: 14cm<sup>2</sup> rounds to  10cm<sup>2</sup>.
