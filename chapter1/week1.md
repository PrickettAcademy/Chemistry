## Notes:
- When doing math with measurements you need to be careful to keep the right number of significant digits.
- When adding numbers, the answer can only be as **precise** as the **least precise** number being added.
- When multiplying numbers, the answer must have the same number of **significant figures** as the number with the **least** number of significant figures.
- There is always some error in the last significant figure in a measurement.
- When you have a relationship between 2 units, you can convert from one unit to another. This is called `Unit Conversion`.
- The metric system has prefixes that tell you how that measurement is related to the base measurement.
- The prefixes are mega, kilo, hecto, deca, centi, milli, micro, and nano.
- Scientific notation allows us to more easily represent measurements. 

## Examples:
**Adding 2 measurements: 23 ft + 3.01 ft**
- First, we need to identify the least precise number. The first number's smallest significant digit is the 3 which is in the ones place. The second number's smallest significant digit is 1 and is in the hundredth's place. Since, the hundredth's place is to the right of the ones place, hundredths is MORE precise. So, the ones place is LESS precise. That means that 23 ft is LESS precise than 3.01 ft. So, our answer must be no more precise than the one's place. And we must round to the nearest one's place for the answer. 
- Now, we add the numbers as normal: 23 ft + 3.01 ft = 26.01 ft
- Finally, we round to the nearest one's place: 26.01 ft to the nearest one is 26 ft. 
- *Note that subtraction has the same rules as addition*

**Adding 3 measurements: 25cm + 40cm + 13cm**
- The least precise number is 40cm because it only has one significant digit - the 4. The 4 is in the ten's place.
- Add them all together (no rounding yet): 25cm + 40cm + 13cm = 78cm
- Finally, round the answer to the nearest ten: 78cm to the nearest ten is 80cm

**Multiplying 2 measurements: 3.5cm * 4cm**
- First, we need to count the significant digits in both numbers. The first number has 2 significant digits and the second number has 1 significant digit. That means our answer can only have 1 significant digit. We will have to round the answer to get it down to the right number of significant digits.
- Now, we multiply as normal: 3.5cm * 4cm = 14cm<sup>2</sup>
- Finally, round the answer to the nearest number that will give us just one significant figure: 14cm<sup>2</sup> rounds to  10cm<sup>2</sup>.
- *Note that subtraction has the same rules as addition*

**Multiplying 3 measurements: 3.5cm * 4.0cm * 120cm**
- The least number of significant figures is 2, because all of the numbers have 2 significant figures.
- Now, we multiply (no rounding yet): 3.5cm * 4.0cm * 120cm = 168<sup>3</sup>
- Finally, rount the answer to get 2 significant figures: 168<sup>3</sup> rounds to 170<sup>3</sup>

**Converting from inches to centimeters: what is 24 inches as centimeters**
- First, we need to identify the relationship between the two units. We can either look up the relationship in a table or on the internet OR we could measure something in both units to find out the relationship. In either case, we should represent this relationship as a fraction. This fraction is actually equal to the value 1 because the value on the top is equal to the value on the bottom. This means we can use the fraction as in/cm or cm/in depending on what we need. In this case, we want to get rid of inches and end up with centimeters. The unit you want to get rid of should always go on the bottom. So, let's use 2.5cm/1.0in.
- Now we multiply by our relationship: 24in * 2.5cm/1.0in = 60cm
- Note that when we multiply we treat the units like an X or Y in an algebra calculation. Let's replace in with X and cm with Y to see what I mean. 24X * 2.5Y/1.0X = because these values are all multiplied, I can cross out the X on top with the X on bottom. That leaves: 24 * 2.5Y/1.0 which equals 60Y. If we replace Y back with cm, we get 60cm.
- Don't forget that we need to write the answer with the right number of significant figures. Our original numbers all had 2 significant figures. But our answer only has 1. We have lost some significance. To fix that, we need to right the number in **Scientific Notation** as 6.0 * 10 cm.

**Writing 230cm in scientific notation**
- First, isolate all the significant digits and write them with a decimal after the first digit. In this case, only the 2 and the 3 are significant. So, we would write it as 2.3.
- Second, figurat out how many 10s we need to multiply this new number by to get the original. In other words, 2.3 * 10 * 10 = 230. That's 2 10s. We can write that as 10<sub>2</sub>.
- Finally, we put them together: 2.3 * 10<sup>2</sup> cm
- Dont' forget the units

**Writing 0.00230cm in scientific notation**
- Isolate the significant digits and rewrite them: 2.30 (notice that the last zero is significant because it is after the decimal point, but the leading zeros are not because they are before the first significant digit).
- Second how many 10s to we need. Well, in this case the number got bigger not smaller. That means we need to divide by 10s instead of multiplying: 2.30 / 10 / 10 / 10 = 0.00230
- Finally, put them together: 2.30 * 10<sup>-3</sup> cm
