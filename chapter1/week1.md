## Notes:
- When doing math with measurements you need to be careful to keep the right number of significant digits.
- When adding numbers, the answer can only be as **precise** as the **least precise** number being added.
- When multiplying numbers, the answer must have the same number of **significant figures** as the number with the **least** number of significant figures.
- There is always some error in the last significant figure in a measurement.
- When you have a relationship between 2 units, you can convert from one unit to another. This is called `Unit Conversion`.
- The metric system has prefixes that tell you how that measurement is related to the base measurement.
- The prefixes are mega, kilo, hecto, deca, centi, milli, micro, and nano.
- Scientific notation allows us to more easily represent measurements.
