# Class 1 Agenda

## What's the Matter?
- Chemistry is the study of matter.
- `Matter` - Anything that has mass and takes up space.

## Measuring Up
- When measuring something, always estimate the distince between the marks. 
- Always include the units with your measurements.

## Significant Digits/Figures
- A digit (or figure) in a measurement is significant if it is not a zero. 
- A zero digit is significant if it is between non-zero digits or to the right of non-zero digits AND to the right of the decimal point.
- When doing math with measurements you need to be careful to keep the right number of significant digits.
- When adding numbers, the answer can only be as **precise** as the **least precise** number being added.
- When multiplying numbers, the answer must have the same number of **significant figures** as the number with the **least** number of significant figures.
- There is always some error in the last significant figure in a measurement.
- Scientific notation allows us to more easily represent measurements. 

## Going Metric
- When you have a relationship between 2 units, you can convert from one unit to another. This is called `Unit Conversion`.
- The metric system has prefixes that tell you how that measurement is related to the base measurement.
- The prefixes are mega, kilo, hecto, deca, centi, milli, micro, and nano.
