## Notes

- Oxidation state - the charge on an ion or, in a molecule, the charge that an atom would have if the shared electrons in a bond were always given to the more electronegative atom.
- Rules for determining oxidation status:
  - ALWAYS TRUE
    - For ions composed of only one atom, the oxidation state is equal to the charge of the ion.
    - For all elements and homonuclear molecules, the ozidation state of each atom is 0.
    - For molecules and polyatomic ions, the sum of the oxidation states must equal the total charge.
    - The oxidation state of flourine in any compound is 1-.
    - In covalent compounds and polyatomic ions, H has an oxidation state of 1+.
  - USUALLY TRUE
    - In most compounds, oxygen has an oxidation state of 2-.
    - Group 7A elements (especially chlorine) usually have an oxidation state of 1-.
