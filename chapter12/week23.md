## Notes

- [Video introducing Redox reactions](https://youtu.be/5rtJdjas-mY)
- Oxidation state - the charge on an ion or, in a molecule, the charge that an atom would have if the shared electrons in a bond were always given to the more electronegative atom.
- Rules for determining oxidation status:
  - ALWAYS TRUE
    - For ions composed of only one atom, the oxidation state is equal to the charge of the ion.
    - For all elements and homonuclear molecules, the ozidation state of each atom is 0.
    - For molecules and polyatomic ions, the sum of the oxidation states must equal the total charge.
    - The oxidation state of flourine in any compound is 1-.
    - In covalent compounds and polyatomic ions, H has an oxidation state of 1+.
  - USUALLY TRUE
    - In most compounds, oxygen has an oxidation state of 2-.
    - Group 7A elements (especially chlorine) usually have an oxidation state of 1-.
- In a redox (reduction/oxidation) reaction, atoms lose/gain electrons. Atoms that gain electrons are **reduced** while atoms that lose electrons are **oxidized**. (gaining electrons makes the charge more negative, making it smaller or reducing it)
- **LEO says GER** - Lose Electrons Oxidation - Gain Electrons Reduction
- If a reactant is reduced, it is called the oxidizing agent, because it oxidized another reactant.
- If a reactant is oxidized, it is called the reducing agent, because it reduces another reactant.

- Galvanic cell - a system that uses a redox reaction to produce electrical energy.
- Anode - the negative electrode in a galvanic cell or a battery.
- Cathode - the positive electrode in a galvanic cell or a battery.

## Examples

CC1. oxidation state for: MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CaO, SF<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>
- The first 2 are ionic compounds, so the oxidation state is the same as the ion charge
- Mg is in 2A and Cl is in 7A. So, the oxidation states (aka charges) are Mg +2 and Cl -1
- Ca is in 2A and O is in 6A. So, the oxidation states are Ca +2 and O -2
- SF<sub>2</sub> is a covalent compound (but I know F is always -1 and the sum must be 0)
- So, the oxidation states are F -1 and S +2
- O<sub>2</sub> is a homonuclear molecule. So, the oxidation state for O is 0.

CC2. oxidation state for: Hg, Li<sub>2</sub>S, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub>
- Hg is an atom - 0
- Li<sub>2</sub>S is ionic (metal and non-metal). Li is in 1A which is 1+. The sum has to be 0. So, S is -2.
- K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is ionic. K is +1 (column 1A) and SO<sub>4</sub> is -2. if O is -2, then S is +6
- Cl<sub>2</sub> is homonuclear - 0
- NF<sub>3</sub> - F is -1. So N must be +3
- CH<sub>4</sub> is covalent so H is +1. So, C must be -4
- PCl<sub>3</sub> is covalent. If Cl is -1, then P is +3

CC3. Identify redox or not, what was oxidized/reduced and oxidizing agent and reducing agent.
- SF<sub>4</sub> (g) + F<sub>2</sub> (g) --> SF<sub>6</sub> (g)
  - [+4, -1] + [0] --> [+6, -1]
  - this is a redox reaction because oxidation states changed for some of the Fs and all the Ss
  - S was oxidized (lost electrons) and F was reduced (gained them)
  - SF<sub>4</sub> is the reducing agent since it contained the S that was oxidized
  - F<sub>2</sub> is the oxidizing agent since it contained the F that was reduced
- HCl + KOH --> H<sub>2</sub>O + KCl
  - [+1, -1] + [+1, -2, +1] --> [+1, -2] + [+1, -1]
  - No oxidation states changed - not a redox reaction
- 3Cu (s) + 2HNO<sub>3</sub> (aq) + 6H<sup>+</sup> --> 3Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2NO (g) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O (l)
  - [0] + [+1, +5, -2] + [+1] --> [+2] + [+2, -2] + [+1, -2]
  - this is a redox reaction because oxidation states changed 
  - Cu is oxidized and is the reducing agent since it loses electrons
  - N is reduced and HNO<sub>3</sub> is the oxidizing agent since it gains electrons
  
CC4. Is the Mg side of a galvanic cell the anode or cathode if it is becoming Mg<sup>2+</sup>?
- If you look at the diagram on page 370 of the Galvanic cell, you can see that the negative side of the cell has that metal that is losing electrons (i.e. it is being oxidized). Since that side is losing electrons, it produces positive ions.
- In this case we know that this side of the cell is also producing positive ions, which means it must be the negative side of the cell with a metal being oxidized and thus the **anode**

CC5. Why did the students Galvanic cell stop working?
- most likely **the salt bridge** between the 2 sides of the cell is not working any longer. The salt bridge is there to keep the charges from building up on either side. Once one side builds up a charge the flow of electrons will stop because they are either repelled or held back by the charges.

## Optional Videos

- [This video shows you how to calculate oxidation numbers (oxidation states). He has slightly different ways of expressing the rules than me, but as he points out, it doesnâ€™t matter. You get the same answer and use the same reasoning regardless of the rules you use.](https://youtu.be/-a2ckxhfDjQ)
