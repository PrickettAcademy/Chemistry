## Notes

- Oxidation state - the charge on an ion or, in a molecule, the charge that an atom would have if the shared electrons in a bond were always given to the more electronegative atom.
- Rules for determining oxidation status:
  - ALWAYS TRUE
    - For ions composed of only one atom, the oxidation state is equal to the charge of the ion.
    - For all elements and homonuclear molecules, the ozidation state of each atom is 0.
    - For molecules and polyatomic ions, the sum of the oxidation states must equal the total charge.
    - The oxidation state of flourine in any compound is 1-.
    - In covalent compounds and polyatomic ions, H has an oxidation state of 1+.
  - USUALLY TRUE
    - In most compounds, oxygen has an oxidation state of 2-.
    - Group 7A elements (especially chlorine) usually have an oxidation state of 1-.
- In a redox (reduction/oxidation) reaction, atoms lose/gain electrons. Atoms that gain electrons are **reduced** while atoms that lose electrons are **oxidized**. (gaining electrons makes the charge more negative, making it smaller or reducing it)
- **LEO says GER** - Lose Electrons Oxidation - Gain Electrons Reduction
- If a reactant is reduced, it is called the oxidizing agent, because it oxidized another reactant.
- If a reactant is oxidized, it is called the reducing agent, because it reduces another reactant.

## Examples

CC1. oxidation state for: MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CaO, SF<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>
- The first 2 are ionic compounds, so the oxidation state is the same as the ion charge
- Mg is in 2A and Cl is in 7A. So, the oxidation states (aka charges) are Mg 2+ and Cl 1-
- Ca is in 2A and O is in 6A. So, the oxidation states are Ca 2+ and O 2-
- SF<sub>2</sub> is a covalent compound (but I know F is always 1- and the sum must be 0)
- So, the oxidation states are F 1- and S 2+
- O<sub>2</sub> is a homonuclear molecule. So, the oxidation state for O is 0.

CC2. oxidation state for: Hg, Li<sub>2</sub>S, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub>
- Hg is an atom - 0
- Li<sub>2</sub>S is ionic (metal and non-metal). Li is in 1A which is 1+. The sum has to be 0. So, S is 2-.
- K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is ionic. K is 1+ (column 1A) and SO<sub>4</sub> is 2-. if O is 2-, then S is 6+
- Cl<sub>2</sub> is homonuclear - 0
- NF<sub>3</sub> - F is 1-. So N must be 3+
- CH<sub>4</sub> is covalent so H is 1+. So, C must be 4-
- PCl<sub>3</sub> is covalent. If Cl is 1-, then P is 3+

CC3. Identify redox or not, what was oxidized/reduced and oxidizing agent and reducing agent.
- SF<sub>4</sub> (g) + F<sub>2</sub> (g) --> SF<sub>6</sub> (g)
  - [4+, 1-] + [0] --> [6+, 1-]
  - this is a redox reaction because oxidation states changed for some of the Fs and all the Ss
  - S was oxidized (lost electrons) and F was reduced (gained them)
  - SF<sub>4</sub> is the oxidizing agent
  - F<sub>2</sub> is the reducing agent
- HCl + KOH --> H<sub>2</sub>O + KCl
  - [1+,1-] + [1+, 2-, 1+] --> [1+, 2-] + [1+, 1-]
  - No oxidation states changed - not a redox reaction
- 3Cu (s) + 2HNO<sub>3</sub> (aq) + 6H<sup>+</sup> --> 3Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2NO (g) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O (l)
  - [0] + [1+, 5+, 2-] + [1+] --> [2+] + [2+, 2-] + [1+, 2-]
  - this is a redox reaction because oxidation states changed
