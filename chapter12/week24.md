## Notes

- Galvanic cells are powered by Redox reactions and we can use the equations to label everything in the cell.
- For chemical equations to be balanced, the total charge on each side of the equation must be the same.
- electroplating - using reduction (usually powered by electricity) to coat an object with a mtal.
- corrosion is also caused by redox reactions
- corrosion - the chemical deterioration of a substance, usually by oxidation.

## Examples

CC6. Draw galvanic cells for the following reactions
- 3Fe (s) + 2Co<sup>3+</sup> (aq) --> 3Fe<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2Co (s)
- ![Fe Galvanic Cell](FeGalvanicCell1.jpg)
- I<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 2Cr<sup>2+</sup> --> 2I<sup>-</sup> (aq) + 2Cr<sup>3+</sup> (aq)
- ![I2 Galvanic Cell](I2GalvanicCell.jpg)

CC7. Balance these redox equations
- Al (s) + **3**Cu<sup>+</sup> (aq) --> Al<sup>3+</sup> (aq) + **3**Cu (s)
- **2**Cr (s) + **3**Ni<sup>2+</sup> (aq) --> **2**Cr<sup>3+</sup> (aq) + **3**Ni (s)

CC8. Identify the reactant found on the positive side of a lead-acid battery. Identify the substance found at the negative side.
- Looking back at the chapter, the reaction is just above and the oxidation states are described. 
- **The positive side of the battery must contain PbO<sub>2</sub> since it has the most positive oxidation state**
- **The negative side of the batter must contain Pb since it has the least positive oxidation state**

CC9. A dry cell has a Ph of 13.9.
- **That means it is a base which implies it is an alkaline battery**

CC10. how to determine if something is gold plated or solid gold?
- Use water displacement to get the volume and then calculate the density 
- Compare that density to the known density of gold.
