## Notes

- Galvanic cells are powered by Redox reactions and we can use the equations to label everything in the cell.
- For chemical equations to be balanced, the total charge on each side of the equation must be the same.
- electroplating - using reduction (usually powered by electricity) to coat an object with a mtal.
- corrosion is also caused by redox reactions
- corrosion - the chemical deterioration of a substance, usually by oxidation.

## Examples

CC6. Draw galvanic cells for the following reactions
- 3Fe (s) + 2Co<sup>3+</sup> (aq) --> 3Fe<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2Co (s)
- ![Fe Galvanic Cell](FeGalvanicCell1.jpg)
- I<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 2Cr<sup>2+</sup> --> 2I<sup>-</sup> (aq) + 2Cr<sup>3+</sup> (aq)
