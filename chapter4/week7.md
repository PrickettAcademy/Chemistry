## Notes
- The current model of the atom is called the **quantum mechanical model**. It's similar to the Bohr model except that electrons are treated as waves instead of particles and live in orbitals instead of orbits.
- Photons act like particles in some ways and like waves in other ways. Because they are waves the photon waves can interfere with each other. This is called **constructive interference** when the waves get bigger and **destructive interference** when the waves get smaller.
- You can see the wave interference by shining the light through small openings/slits that are close enough together. Thomas Young studied this in 1801.
- Light also behaves like a particle as in **photoelectric effect** when light is shown on a metal and causes it to emit electrons.
- **orbitals** are shapes that define an area where the electron lives. They are sometimes called **electron clouds**.
- The **s orbitals** are spherical and the **p orbitals** are shaped like dumbbells.

- s orbitals start at energy level 1 and exist in all the other energy levels. There is only 1 s orbital in each energy level.
- p orbitals start at energy level 2 and exist in all higher levels as well. There are 3 p orbitals in each energy level that has them.
- d orbitals start at energy level 3 and exist in all higher levels as well. There are 5 d orbitals in each energy level that has them.
- there are new orbital shapes at every energy level. Energy level 4 has f orbitals and energy level 5 has g orbitals.
- Each orbital can only hold 2 electrons

- **Wave-particle duality** - the concept that light as well as many subatomic particals have the properties of both particles and waves.
- **Aufbau principle** - Electrons fill orbitals starting with the lowest-energy ones and then filling higher-energy orbitals as needed.
- Carbon has electrons in the following orbitals: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>


## Examples

CC2. What types of orbitals are available to an electron in the second energy level? How many total orbitals are available to it?
- First, let's list the first few orbitals we know 1s, 2s, 2p<sub>x</sub>, 2p<sub>y</sub>, 2p<sub>z</sub>, then there are 5 3d orbitals.
- Only 2s, 2p<sub>x</sub>, 2p<sub>y</sub>, 2p<sub>z</sub> are in the second energy level.
- So, **there are 2 types available s and p**
- And there are exactly **4 orbitals** that are in that energy level

CC3. An electron occupies a d orbital. What is its minimum energy level?
- d orbitals start at **energy level 3**.
