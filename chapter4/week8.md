## Notes

- In class we went over how to fill the electron configuration with the following chart
![K_electron_config.jpg](K_electron_config.jpg)

- **Ionic compounds** are formed between metals and nonmetals.
- NaCl (salt) is made from sodium, a metal, and clorine, a nonmetal. Metals prefer to lose their outter electrons so Na becomes Na<sup>+</sup>. Nonmetals prefer to gain electrons so Cl becomes Cl<sup>-</sup>. Together they are neutral, just NaCl.
- When Na combines with S (Sulfur), Sulfur wants 2 electrons, so it combines with 2 atoms of Na. This forms Na<sub>2</sub>S.
- The transition metals do not follow the normal rules for ionic compounds
- Copper (Cu) can combine with Cl in 2 different ways to form completely different compounds. 
- We use roman numerals in the names of copper (I) chloride and copper (II) chloride to show how ions combined.
- Ionic compounds split up into their ions when dissolved and those ions move freely in the solution.
- **electrolytes** are chemicals that form a conductive solution when dissolved.
- pure water does NOT conduct electricity, but most water is not pure and does conduct electricity.

## Examples

CC10. Name and chemical formula for aluminum and nitrogen
- Al is a metal in column 3A, so it wants to lose 3 electrons and become Al<sup>3+</sup>.
- N is a non-metal in column 5A so it wants to gain 3 electrons and become N<sup>3-</sup>.
- These should combine to form simply **AlN** since the charges have the same number.
- Since nitrogen is the anion, it is renamed nitride.
- The full name would be **Aluminum Nitride**.

CC12. What's the chemical formula for alumninum oxide
- The metal is Al<sup>3+</sup> (in column 5A)
- The nonmetal is O<sup>2-</sup> (in column 6A)
- If we have 2 Al atoms, that gives us 6 electrons that can combine with 3 O atoms to give us a neutral compound
- So the formula is **Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>**
